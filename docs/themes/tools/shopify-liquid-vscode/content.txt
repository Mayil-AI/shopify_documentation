 The Shopify Liquid Visual Studio Code extension is built on top of Shopify's Liquid Language Server and offers the following features:
 Syntax highlighting
 Documentation on hover
 Code completion and documentation
 Code formatting
 Code navigation
 Auto-closing pairs
 Theme checks
 Syntax highlighting
 The Shopify Liquid VS Code extension offers syntax highlighting. The syntax highlighting grammar is officially maintained by Shopify and is the same one that GitHub uses to highlight Liquid code.
 Documentation on hover
 You can hover your mouse over any piece of Liquid or HTML code in a theme to browse its definition, type, and documentation.
 The hover menu includes clickable links to the official reference in your browser.
 Code completion and documentation
 The following elements of a Liquid theme are contextually completed by the extension:
 Liquid tags, filters, objects, and object properties
 HTML tags, attributes, and attribute values
 Theme, section and block settings
 Translation keys
 Snippet names
 A quick information window is also available and can be toggled in the following ways:
 By clicking on the caret in the completion menu
 By pressing the completion keyboard shortcut a second time
 Keyboard shortcuts: Mac ^Space, Windows Ctrl+Space
 Code formatting
 Code formatting is powered by the Liquid Prettier plugin and can be applied in the following ways:
 Automatically on save
 By selecting the Format Document right-click menu item
 By running the Format Document command in the command palette
 By pressing the Format Document keyboard shortcut
 Keyboard shortcuts: Mac ⇧⌥F, Windows Shift+Alt+F
 Code navigation
 In Shopify themes, there are multiple ways to include other files. In VS Code, references to other files are announced by an underline.
 You can go to the associated file by using cmd+click on Mac, and ctrl+click on other platforms.
 If the file doesn't exist, VS Code will let you create one.
 Auto-closing pairs
 The extension will close Liquid and HTML character pairs for you.
 Theme checks
 Theme check is a linter for Shopify Themes. When it finds a problem with your code, it will add a red or yellow wavy line under it. These errors and warnings (also known as diagnostics) will also appear in the Problems Tab.
 Keyboard shortcuts: Mac ⇧⌘M, Windows Ctrl+Shift+M
 Fixes
 When a diagnostic is auto-fixable, it will be announced by a blue light bulb near the source code.
 A fix can be applied in a couple of different ways:
 Automatically on save
 By selecting it in the Code Actions menu revealed by clicking the blue lightbulb
 By selecting it in the menu that appears after right clicking the diagnostic in the Problems tab
 By running the Auto fix... command in the command palette
 By pressing the Auto fix... keyboard shortcut
 Keyboard shortcuts: Mac ⎇⌘., Windows Ctrl+Alt+.
 Suggestions
 When a diagnostic offers suggestions, you're notified by a yellow light bulb near the source code, or by right clicking on the diagnostic in the Problems tab.
 A diagnostic can offer more than one suggestion, sometimes requires additional attention, and cannot be automatically applied.
 A suggestion can be applied in the following ways:
 By selecting it in the Code Actions menu revealed by clicking the yellow lightbulb.
 By selecting it in the Code Actions menu running the Quick fix... command in the command palette.
 By selecting it in the menu that appears after pressing the Quick fix... keyboard shortcut.
 By selecting it in the menu that appears after right clicking the diagnostic in the Problems tab.
 Keyboard shortcuts: Mac ⌘., Windows Ctrl+.

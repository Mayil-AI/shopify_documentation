 Shopify Theme Kit
 Theme Kit is a cross-platform command line tool that you can use to build Shopify themes.
 Choosing between Shopify CLI and Theme Kit
 Shopify CLI replaces Theme Kit for most Shopify theme development tasks. You should use Shopify CLI if you're working on Online Store 2.0 themes. You should use Theme Kit instead of Shopify CLI only if you're working on older themes.

 With Theme Kit, you can use your own development tools to interact with the Shopify platform in the following ways:
 Use workflow tools like Git to work with a team of theme developers.
 Upload themes to multiple environments.
 Watch for local changes and upload them automatically to Shopify.
 Work on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

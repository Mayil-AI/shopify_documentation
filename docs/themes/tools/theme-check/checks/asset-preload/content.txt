 AssetPreload
 Encourages preloading of assets using Liquid filters, rather than HTML attributes.
 Preloading helps to make sure that critical assets are downloaded by the browser as soon as possible for better rendering performance.
 Liquid provides multiple filters to preload key resources so they can be converted into Link headers automatically. This enables them to be discovered faster, especially when combined with early hints that Shopify supports.

 ✓ Pass

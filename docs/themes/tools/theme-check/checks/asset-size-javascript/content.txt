 AssetSizeJavascript
 Prevents using theme JavaScript files and external scripts with a compressed size greater than the configured threshold_in_bytes. Limiting the size of JavaScript files helps to improve the performance of your theme.
 You occasionally might need to load large JavaScript bundles. In these cases, you can use an import on interaction pattern to avoid having users who don't interact with a component execute the bundle.
 Examples
 The following examples contain code snippets that either fail or pass this check.
 ✗ Fail
 In the following example, assets/chat-widget.js is greater than 10 KB gzipped:
 1 <script src="chat-widget.js" defer></script>
 ✓ Pass
 1 <script>
 2
    const chatWidgetButton = document.getElementById('#chat-widget')
 3
 4
    chatWidgetButton.addEventListener('click', e => {
 5
      e.preventDefault();
 6
      import("chat-widget.js")
 7
        .then(module => module.default)
 8
        .then(ChatWidget => ChatWidget.init())
 9
        .catch(err => {
 10
          console.error(err);
 11
        });
 12
    });
 13 </script>
 Options
 The following example contains the default configuration for this check:
 For themes:
 1 AssetSizeJavaScript:
 2
    enabled: false
 3
    threshold_in_bytes: 10000
 For theme app extensions:
 1 AssetSizeJavaScript:

 3
    severity: suggestion
 4
    threshold_in_bytes: 10000
 Parameter Description
 enabled Whether this check is enabled.
 severity The severity of the check.
 threshold_in_bytes The maximum allowed compressed size, in bytes, for a single JavaScript file. This includes the theme and remote scripts.
 Disabling this check
 This check is enabled by default when you run the Shopify CLI 3.x build command on an app that contains a theme app extension. This limit is not yet enforced, but disabling this check isn't recommended for theme app extensions.
 If you can't avoid violating the rule, then you should disable the check using the comment syntax. This ensures that you intentionally disable the check for each instance.
 1 {% # theme-check-disable AssetSizeJavaScript %}
 2 <script src="{{ 'chat-widget.js' | asset_url }}" defer></script>
 3 {% # theme-check-enable AssetSizeJavaScript %}

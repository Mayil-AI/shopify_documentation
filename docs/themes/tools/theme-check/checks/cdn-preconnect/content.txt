 CdnPreconnect
 The preconnect resource hint is a useful way of making sure connections to external domains are ready as soon as possible. It can improve performance by enabling the browser to start downloading critical assets right after discovering them in the HTML.
 Because every Shopify store makes use of cdn.shopify.com, the platform already includes the preconnect resource hint inside the Link header in the main document response. This makes the preconnect in the HTML redundant.
 With the rollout of moving CDN assets to the main store domain, it becomes even more unnecessary as there may be no assets coming from cdn.shopify.com. In this case, the redundant preconnect can negatively impact performance.

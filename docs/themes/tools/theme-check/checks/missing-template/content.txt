 MissingTemplate
 Identifies when a resource is referenced using a render, section, or include tag, but doesn't exist.
 Examples
 The following examples contain code snippets that either fail or pass this check.
 ✗ Fail
 In the following example, there is no corresponding snippet-that-does-not-exist file in the theme:
 1 {% render 'snippet-that-does-not-exist' %}
 ✓ Pass
 In the following example, article-card exists in the snippets directory of the theme:
 1 {% render 'article-card' %}
 Options
 1 MissingTemplate:
 2
    enabled: true
 3
    ignore:
 4
    - path-to-file/filename1.md
 5
    ignore_missing:
 6
    - path-to-file/filename-*
 Parameter Description
 enabled Whether this check is enabled.
 ignore A list of files to ignore instances of missing templates within.
 ignore_missing A list of patterns of missing template files to ignore.
 ignore and ignore_missing
 The ignore option instructs Theme Check to ignore all occurrences of MissingTemplate according to the file in which they appear.
 For example, using the following setting, Theme Check ignores all MissingTemplate errors in templates/index.liquid, no matter the file being rendered:
 1 MissingTemplate:
 2
    ignore:
 3
    - templates/index.liquid
 The ignore_missing option instructs Theme Check to ignore all occurrences of MissingTemplate based on the target template being rendered.
 For example, using the following setting, Theme Check ignores offenses on {% render 'icon-missing' %} across all theme files:
 1 MissingTemplate:
 2
    ignore_missing:
 3
    - snippets/icon-*
 Auto-correction
 Theme Check can correct this error using the --auto-correct flag. When the flag is specified, Theme Check creates missing resources referenced using an include or render tag in the snippets directory, and creates missing resources referenced using a section tag in the sections directory. These resources are created as empty Liquid files.

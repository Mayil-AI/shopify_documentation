 DeprecateLazysizes
 Discourages use of the lazysizes JavaScript library for lazy loading images, iframes, and scripts.
 You should avoid using third-party libraries over native browser features to avoid large JavaScript bundle sizes and slow load times. Learn more about theme performance.
 This check identifies uses of the lazyload class, data-srcset and data-sizes attributes, and data-sizes="auto".

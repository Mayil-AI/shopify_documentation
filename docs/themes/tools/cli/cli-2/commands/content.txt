 init
 Clones a Git repository to your local machine to use as the starting point for building a theme.
 If no Git repository is specified, then this command creates a copy of Dawn, Shopify's example theme, with the specified name in the current folder. If no name is provided, then you're prompted to enter one.
 Terminal
 $ shopify theme init [ NAME ] [ options ]
 Caution
 If you're building a theme for the Shopify Theme Store, then you can use Dawn as a starting point. However, the theme that you submit needs to be substantively different from Dawn so that it provides added value for users. Learn about the ways that you can use Dawn.
 Optional parameters
 Parameter Short version Description
 NAME The name that you want to give your theme. Cloned files are stored in a folder with this name.
 --clone-url <URL> -u <URL> The URL of the Git repository that you want to clone. If no URL is specified, then https://github.com/Shopify/dawn.git is used.
 serve
 Uploads the current theme as the specified theme, or a development theme, to the store that you're connected to.
 This command also returns the following information:
 A link to your development theme at http://127.0.0.1:9292. This URL can hot reload local changes to CSS and sections, or refresh the entire page when a file changes, enabling you to preview changes in real time using the store's data.
 You can specify a different network interface and port using --host and --port.
 A link to the editor for the theme in the Shopify admin.
 A preview link that you can share with other developers.
 If you already have a development theme for your current environment, then this command replaces the development theme with your local theme. You can override this using the --theme-editor-sync flag.
 Note
 You can't preview checkout customizations using http://127.0.0.1:9292.
 Development themes are deleted when you run shopify logout. If you need a preview link that can be used after you log out, then you should share your theme or push to an unpublished theme on your store.
 You can run this command only in a directory that matches the default Shopify theme folder structure.
 Terminal
 $ shopify theme serve [ ROOT ] [ options ]
 Optional parameters
 Parameter Short version Description
 --live-reload <MODE> The level at which content is reloaded when changes are made to the theme.

 hot-reload - Hot reloads local changes to the CSS and sections (default)
 full-page - Refreshes the entire page when a file is modified
 off - Deactivates live reload
 --host <IP> The network interface that the web server listens on. The default value is 127.0.0.1.
 --port <PORT> The local port to serve the theme preview from.
 --poll Forces the polling adapter to watch file changes. You can try this option if live reload isn't working as expected.
 --theme-editor-sync -e Enables two-way sync for theme JSON files. When this option is enabled, changes made in the theme editor in the Shopify admin are applied to the local copy of the theme.
 
 If you run the serve command with this flag and you already have a development theme for your current environment, then the local and remote themes are compared. If there are any differences between files in the local copy of the theme and remote development theme, then the differing files are listed. You're prompted to overwrite your local or remote version, or merge the files.
 --theme <NAME_OR_ID> -t <NAME_OR_ID> Specify the ID or name of the theme that you want to serve. If you don't use this flag, then the theme is served using a new or existing development theme.

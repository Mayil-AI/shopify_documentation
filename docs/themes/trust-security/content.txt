 Trust and security
 Trust and security are important aspects of a theme for both merchants, and customers.
 To help protect merchants from spam, Shopify uses captcha on customer, contact, and blog comment forms.
 To help assure customers that a merchant's shop is secure, Shopify offers security badges that can be linked to Shopify documentation on Payment Card Industry (PCI) standard compliance.

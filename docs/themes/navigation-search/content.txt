 Store navigation and search
 Customers should be able to easily discover store content. To help with this, you can implement the following methods in your theme:
 Store navigation: Merchants can create menus that highlight store content, which can be featured in places like the header and footer to allow customers to easily browse content.
 Search functionality: Customers are often looking for something specific, so you should provide the option to search the store directly, rather than make customers manually navigate to find what they're looking for.
 Filtering: Merchants can add filtering to collection and search pages to allow customers to further specify the content they want to browse.

 Pricing and payments
 Being able to clearly see pricing and discounts, as well as payment options, are important factors for customers making purchases from a merchant's store.
 Some merchants might sell products in specific quantities or measurements, or as part of a selling plan. To support this, Shopify provides merchants the option to set up unit pricing, as well as Subscriptions and Pre-orders and Try before you buy.
 To help make the payment process easier, Shopify integrates with payment providers that can offer accelerated checkouts, and some merchants can utilize Shop Pay to allow customers to pay in installments.

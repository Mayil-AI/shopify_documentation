 Pre-orders and Try Before You Buy (TBYB)
 Merchants are able to offer various options for purchasing goods and services at checkout through a pre-order or TBYB app. For example, customers can pre-order a product delivery, pay nothing upfront, and have it delivered a month later. Only once delivered will the customer be charged.
 Tip
 To be eligible to use Shopify subscriptions, merchants must meet the qualifying criteria.
 How it works
 To enable pre-orders, apps create selling plan groups, within which they create selling plans. These selling plans are linked to products and product variants. For example, a selling plan group called "Pre-order" can offer selling plans that enable the customer to choose the amount they pay at the time of purchase. Merchants can offer multiple optional selling plans to customers, or specify a required selling plan for a product, such as "pre-order-only" offers.

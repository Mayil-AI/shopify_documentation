 Unit pricing
 If a merchant sells products in specific quantities or measurements, they might need to display a price per unit for those products. For example, if a product is sold in weights of 500g, 1kg, and 1.5kg, a merchant might want to show the price per 100g for each variant.
 In this tutorial, you'll learn how to display unit prices for product variants.
 Tip
 Unit prices are available only to stores located in Germany or France. Unit prices can be added to products through the Shopify admin.
 Resources
 To display unit prices in your theme, you'll use the following:
 The unit_price_measurement object
 The unit_price property
 Depending on where you're implementing your unit price display, you'll access unit price information through the associated parent object:

 Implementing unit price displays
 You should add support for unit prices wherever you have a price display. Common locations include:
 The collection template
 The product template
 The cart template
 The customers/order template
 You can include this code in the relevant template or a section in the template.
 Your code should do the following:
 Check whether the variant or line item has a unit price measurement using variant.unit_price_measurement or line_item.unit_price_measurement.
 If the variant or line item uses a unit price measurement, display the unit price, the reference value, and the reference unit.
 Example
 variant
 line_item
 1 {% if variant.unit_price_measurement %}
 2
    {{ variant.unit_price | money }}
 3
 4
    {% if variant.unit_price_measurement.reference_value != 1 %}
 5
      {{ variant.unit_price_measurement.reference_value }}
 6
    {% endif %}
 7
 8
    {{ variant.unit_price_measurement.reference_unit }}
 9 {% endif %}

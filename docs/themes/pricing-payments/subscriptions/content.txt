 Subscriptions
 Users are able to offer various options for purchasing goods and services at checkout through a subscription app. For example, customers can subscribe to a product delivery every month for a 10% discount, or every week for a 20% discount.
 Tip
 To be eligible to use Shopify subscriptions, merchants must meet the qualifying criteria.
 How it works
 To enable subscriptions, apps create selling plan groups, within which they create selling plans. These selling plans are linked to products and product variants. For example, a selling plan group called "Subscribe & Save" can offer selling plans that enable the customer to choose the delivery frequency and billing frequency separately. Merchants can offer multiple optional selling plans to customers, or specify a required selling plan for a product, such as "subscription-only" offers.

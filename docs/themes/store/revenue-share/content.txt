 Theme revenue share
 Revenue share for Shopify Theme Store developers
 Theme developers can earn revenue by selling their themes to merchants on the Shopify Theme Store. Shopify collects 0% of the first $1,000,000 USD in annual gross theme revenue earned through the Shopify Theme Store. Total theme revenues in excess of $1,000,000 USD annually are subject to a 15% revenue share.
 This revenue share plan applies to all themes listed on the Shopify Theme Store. There are no fees to submit themes for listing on the Shopify Theme Store.
 Calculating Shopify Theme Store revenue
 Revenue share for theme sales is calculated using the following formula:
 Partners pay 0% revenue share until they reach 1,000,000 USD in gross theme revenues for that calendar year.
 After they reach 1,000,000 USD, Partners pay 15% on theme revenues for the remainder of that calendar year.
 Every year on January 1, the revenue share resets to 0% until the Partner reaches 1,000,000 USD threshold again for that calendar year.
 Revenue share calculation for themes is subject to the following conditions:
 If a Partner earns revenue across multiple themes, then revenue share is calculated based on the total cumulative revenue of all the themes, including themes developed under any Associated Theme Developer Accounts.
 Even though total gross theme revenue is calculated across all Associated Theme Developer Accounts, revenue share is still paid out separately at the partner account level.
 Other income, such as from the Shopify App Store or referrals, isn't included in revenue share calculation for the Shopify Theme Store. Learn more about app revenue share.
 Tip
 Revenue share is calculated based on gross sales, not net sales. Refunds aren't taken into account when revenue share is calculated.

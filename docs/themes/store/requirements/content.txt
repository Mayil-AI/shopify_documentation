 Theme store requirements
 Use the following lists of requirements when creating your theme.
 All themes must meet all of the following requirements to be published on the Shopify Theme Store. If your theme is missing any of the requirements in this list, then your submission will be rejected and you will need to make further changes to your theme before it can be resubmitted. To reduce your chance of rejection, you should also test your theme thoroughly.
 Themes must be thoroughly tested before submission to ensure functionality and quality. Themes that haven't been tested thoroughly enough will be rejected without further review, and repeat offences may result in a suspension and/or permanent rejection.
 Learn about the theme review process and how to submit your theme to the Shopify Theme Store.
 1. Theme Store exclusivity
 Themes on the Theme Store must be exclusive to the Theme Store and can't contain external marketing material, so merchants can continue to benefit from the highest quality themes and the newest features.
 All themes must meet the following exclusivity requirements:
 Themes listed on the Shopify Theme Store can only be distributed through the Shopify Theme Store. Themes on the Theme Store must not be distributed on other marketplaces.
 Themes on the Shopify Theme Store can't contain designer credits, such as a link to a theme developer's website, or any affiliate links in the theme files.
 2. Uniqueness from other themes
 If you're building a theme based on our reference theme, Dawn, or based on one of your own themes that's already listed in the Shopify Theme Store, then your theme needs to be substantively different. You must make meaningful changes and innovations to the design and functionality of the theme. Below are some cues that we look for:
 Your codebase must have meaningful differences when contrasted with code from other themes.
 The identity of your theme submission should be unique.
 Your theme should have a clear industry focus.
 Your theme should have an inventive art direction that distinguishes it from other themes.
 Your theme should have a cohesive look and feel across all templates (for example, the index page, product and collection pages, blogs, search, and the cart).
 Your theme should offer unique customization options or functionality that distinguish it from other themes.
 A merchant shouldn't be able to purchase your theme and another theme that's listed in the Shopify Theme Store, and then customize the settings so that the themes are almost identical to each other.
 3. Features

 theme.liquid (layout file)
 404.json

 Themes must include a Custom Liquid section. The section needs to include a setting of type liquid, and should be available on all templates that support sections. The Custom Liquid section can act as an insertion point for certain types of apps.
 Header and footer sections must be rendered within section groups. Section groups allow merchants to dynamically add, remove, and reorder sections in the header and footer areas of the layout.
 Block and app block support requirements
 Themes must support blocks for all or most elements on the main section of the product page. For example, elements such as product price, product vendor, and product description should each be individual blocks within the main product section.

 14. Theme design and UX
 A theme is crucial to a merchant's brand identity, as it represents the merchant to the world in a visual and interactive manner. A theme should have purposeful direction and strong elements of design, but also provide a degree of flexibility that empowers merchants to take full control of their brand image.
 When building Shopify free themes, and assessing themes from our Theme Store Partners, a detailed rubric is used to review the design and UX components of the theme. This ensures that the theme is confidently addressing vital areas such as art direction, consistency, typography, layout, and customer UX.
 Learn more about design best practices.
 Use the following rubric as a guide to better design your custom theme builds.

 Images must adopt a responsive image strategy. Small images such as icons are an exception.
 Images must load only as they are needed to minimize the number of images loaded initially per page.
 18. Naming themes and theme styles
 Choosing a great name for your theme is important when submitting it to the Theme Store. Your theme name helps merchants understand your theme, and ultimately, helps them choose your theme as the right one for their unique needs.
 Theme and theme style naming requirements
 Theme and theme style names must be distinct from Shopify products. You can't use the same name as, or similar to, Shopify products, events, or branded content. For example, don't name your theme Shopify, Unite, or Polaris.
 Theme and theme style names must be distinct from company names. You can’t include the name of your company or Shopify Partner account in your theme name. Your Partner account name is displayed automatically on the theme listing page.
 Theme and theme style names must be distinct from websites, ecommerce platforms, and SEO-related benefits. For example, don't name your theme Performance, Mobile, or Sales.
 Theme and theme style names must be distinct from industries and collections in the Theme Store. For example, don't name your theme Fashion, Electronics, or Jewelry.
 Theme and theme style names must contain 14 characters or fewer.
 Theme names must be unique and distinct from existing themes in the Shopify Theme Store to avoid confusion or conflicts.
 Theme name guidelines
 Use the following guidelines to help you choose the right name for your theme:
 Summarize, or allude to, the purpose of the theme.
 Give the merchant an idea of what to expect when using the theme, the core ideas behind the theme, and the theme's target demographic.
 Use a noun for the name. Nouns are more suitable for creating product names that stick, have identity, and create a lasting impression. A noun can better define the focus of the theme, and offer a better understanding of the shopping experience being offered.
 Use a name that's easy to spell and pronounce. This will help merchants with recall and search.
 Work across different dialects. Since some words and phrases can have different meanings in different regions, you should consult with an idiom dictionary.
 Use a name that's different from theme names on different platforms.
 Theme style name guidelines
 Use the following guidelines to help you choose the right name for your theme style:
 Reflect the design and aesthetics of the theme style.
 Use an adjective for the theme style name. Adjectives are great for describing colours, fonts, and design.
 Compliment the theme name, not compete against it. Merchants often mistake theme styles for theme names, which causes confusion when they contact support to request help with their themes.
 Use a common thread to connect multiple style names for one theme.
 Increasing clarity and discoverability
 For clarity and discoverability, consider the following guidelines when naming your theme and theme style:
 Don't use trendy names. Trends fade, and theme names should transcend trends.
 Don't use unusual spellings. Not only are unusual spellings more difficult to remember, but they’re also more susceptible to autocorrect errors, and they limit discoverability by merchants.
 Don't use lengthy names. Even if you’re trying to be descriptive, creating a long name can hurt a merchant’s ability to remember what your theme is called.
 Don't use the same name as a theme on a different platform.
 Don't use the same name for both the theme and the theme style.
 19. Theme versions and release notes
 Theme versions help merchants easily identify which theme they have, so that they can determine which features are available, or if there are more recent versions to update to.
 When you submit your theme to the Shopify Theme Store, either for the first time or for an update, the theme needs to have a version number and release notes that highlight the main features of the version.
 20. Demo stores
 Setting up a demo store is a great way to showcase your theme's features and functionality, and to provide merchants with real-world examples of how they can use your theme. A demo store that's beautifully designed and functions flawlessly lets merchants explore and interact with your theme, and helps them understand if your theme is right for them.
 To build your demo store, you can use a Shopify development store free of charge.
 Development stores with developer previews enabled can't be transferred. Don't enable any developer previews when creating demo stores.
 Demo store requirements
 All themes must include at least one demo store.
 Each preset requires a demo store. You can use up to 5 demo stores for each theme.
 Each demo store has the Bogus Gateway or Shopify Payments test mode enabled, and all other checkout options disabled.
 All demo store pages must use authentic text content. Don't use Lorem Ipsum or onboarding text. Don't include profanities.
 The powered_by_link link can't be altered and must contain only powered_by_link.
 Affiliate linking isn't allowed.
 Any link in the code that points to one of Shopify's domains must include a rel="nofollow" attribute.
 To avoid potential merchant confusion, demo stores can only showcase elements and functionality that are built into the theme. For example:
 Don't use embedded text or buttons in images, except for the text on physical products, infographics, badges, or instagram images.
 Don't use animated gif images in places where they can be mistaken for theme functionality.
 Don't use apps. In some cases, special consideration applies to free product review apps and free translation apps. If you're showcasing multi-language options using translation apps, then all content must be translated.
 You must obtain the appropriate rights for all demo store assets in accordance with the Shopify Partner Agreement. Before using any brand names, images, or content, permission must be directly granted by the brand owners.

 Demo store recommendations
 When designing your demo store, consider the following recommendations to help you showcase the full potential of your theme. The following recommendations aren't mandatory requirements that need to be met for submission.
 Identify the source of any product images used in the product description.
 Use the latest version of your theme in your demo store.
 Incorporate built-in Shopify features to showcase the power and capabilities of your theme.
 Illustrate the versatility and variability of your theme, by including examples such as a product that's on sale, a sold-out product or variant, a product with multiple variants, and a gift card product.
 21. Documentation and contact forms
 Having clear, detailed, and accessible information about your theme helps merchants feel supported and helps to reduce support issues. Creating organized and effective documentation is important to your overall success as a Theme Partner.
 Documentation and contact form requirements
 You must provide theme documentation and a public support contact form.
 You must have your theme documentation and contact form ready before launching your theme.
 You must link your documentation and contact form to your theme listing page in the Shopify Theme Store.
 Merchant-facing theme documentation
 The copy for all theme documentation must be grammatically correct and free of spelling errors.
 The theme documentation must be consistent with the copy in the theme settings.
 You need to keep your documentation up to date as changes occur within Shopify and you update your theme. As you support merchants using your theme, be sure to identify any gaps in your theme documentation and make updates as necessary.
 Your theme documentation should include an FAQ section and any other relevant information that you feel could help address potential support questions that merchants might have.
 Clear support policy
 Consider specifying your support policy in your theme documentation. As a Theme Partner, you must support bug fixes and answer any merchant questions regarding your theme. You might want to provide additional services to merchants such as customizations, app-integrations, and help with theme updates, but you can't include these services in the cost of your theme.
 Clarity on custom code tutorials
 If you offer custom coding tutorials in your documentation, then specify whether the custom tutorials are supported. Also, include a warning to merchants in your tutorials that they should duplicate their theme before editing their code, and include a suggestion that merchants hire a Shopify Partner for help.
 Contact forms
 Your contact form lets merchants contact you. You should include your contact form in your theme documentation. If you use a modal for your contact form, then make sure that it's mobile friendly and linkable from the Theme Store. Try to avoid fields that ask merchants about budget, phone numbers, project type, or other unnecessary questions. You can have a form outlining your agency work on a separate page, but the contact form that you link to from the Theme Store should comply with the following guidelines.
 Field Guideline
 (First and Last) Name Field
 Email Address Field
 Store URL Field Include an example URL for clarity, such as http://www.storename.myshopify.com.
 Description of Problem Field This should be a text-area field.
 File Upload Function Allow merchants to highlight their issues with images.
 Auto-responder Function The auto-responder is triggered when the contact form is submitted to reduce the amount of merchants contacting Shopify and Theme Partners asking if their support requests have been received.
 Theme Name Provide the theme name if you offer multiple themes.
 Subject If you include this field, then it should auto populate the email subject line.
 22. Supporting your theme
 As a Theme Partner, you're responsible for supporting merchants who use your theme. Being merchant-focused, providing quality support, and having a collaborative attitude with Shopify is essential for the success of your theme.
 Merchant support requests are submitted through your contact form, which you should link to from the Shopify Theme Store and your theme documentation.
 Merchant support requirements
 You must assist merchants with their theme-related questions.
 You must reply to support requests from merchants within two business days.
 If there is a technical issue with your theme, such as a broken layout, a dead link, or a logical error, then you're responsible for fixing the issue in a timely manner.
 You must fix critical bugs immediately or your theme may be temporarily removed from the Theme Store.
 Estimating the support workload
 Being a Theme Partner is a full-time job, and supporting merchants who use your theme is a large part of that. All of our current Theme Partner have dedicated support teams working for them. If you become a Theme Partner, then you’ll need to consider how to balance Theme Partner work with any other jobs that you're currently doing. New Theme Partners typically underestimate the amount of time that they'll need to allocate to support.
 "Merchant support is by far the most challenging part of being a Theme Partner"
 -- Archetype themes
 To understand how much effort is required to support a theme, Shopify merchants currently generate thousands of support tickets each month for the paid themes in the Shopify Theme Store, and support requests continue to grow as more merchants join the platform.

 Testing assets
 To test your theme, you need store data that enables you to test certain cases.
 Shopify provides a few CSV datasets that help you to test these cases in your theme. Import the following CSVs into your store:
 The theme review team product CSV. This is the CSV that the theme review team uses to test your theme for acceptance to the theme store.
 The performance test product CSV. This is the same CSV that you might use to run a Lighthouse audit. You should include this CSV so your store contains a large enough volume of products and collections for certain tests.
 Some features require additional setup before they can be tested in your store.
 Additional setup
 Due to the limitations of the CSV import process, you need to modify some product data and set up some features manually before you can test your theme:
 Inventory quantities
 Local pickup
 Unit pricing
 Rich media
 Selling plans
 Shop Pay Installments
 Inventory quantities
 If your test environment has multiple locations set up, then your store won't import product inventory quantities from CSV files. Instead, all product quantities default to zero.
 Follow the steps below to configure inventory quantities for testing:
 Adjust the inventory quantity on all products, except for Bowtie (Rich Product Media). Leave this product as sold out. You should set up varying quantities for different product variants.
 Update one product with two options so that each has a different quantity and availability. For example, you can use Socks (two options) and set some variants' quantities to zero, or use the following table as a reference. After setup, this product should have some sold out and unavailable variants.
 S/M M/L Kids
 Geometric 0 N/A N/A
 Hotdog 4 N/A N/A
 Dog 3 10 N/A
 Cat 5 0 N/A
 Plain white N/A 6 N/A
 Paw N/A N/A 6
 Local pickup
 To test the local pickup banner on your product page, you need to enable local pickup:
 Enable locations in your store.
 Add five or more locations.
 Enable local pickup in your store.
 Disable the local pickup option for one location.
 Create a product with 5 variants, or use the Enamel pin (1 option) product.
 Set up the quantity and availability for each variant:
 Variant 1: available and in stock at all locations
 Variant 2: available and in stock only in one location
 Variant 3: available in two locations, sold out in one of the locations
 Variant 4: available and in stock only in one location that doesn't offer pickup
 Variant 5: sold out at all locations
 Unit pricing
 To test unit pricing on your products, you need to change or override your store settings, and add unit prices to products:
 Enable unit pricing in one of the following ways:
 Set up a store located in Germany. To test unit pricing in an existing store, you can change your store address to a valid German address in your store details.
 Contact Partner Support to request a unit pricing beta flag for your test store. A beta flag bypasses store settings.
 Add a product with multiple variants, or use any of the multi-variant products that you imported. Set up different unit prices for each variant.
 Rich media
 CSV import doesnâ€™t support rich media. You need to add media to a product to test these features.
 Use the Bowtie (product rich media) product and add the following media:
 Two 3D objects. You can use Shopify sample models.
 One YouTube video
 One Vimeo video
 One MP4 video
 Set all variants of this product to zero, so that you can preview the rich media on the collection page. Setting a quantity for the variant defaults the product card image to the variant image instead of the rich media.
 Selling plans
 Selling plans can only be created and applied to products by an app. To test selling plan elements in your theme, you need to install a subscription app to verify that selling plans are appearing correctly on your theme.
 Shop pay installments
 Enable Shop Pay Installments in one of the following ways:
 Set up a store with a US address
 Contact Partner Support to request a Shop Pay Installments beta flag for your test store. A beta flag bypasses store settings.
 Add a product with multiple variants and varying prices, or use the Socks (2 options) product that you imported.
 Follow on Shop
 Enable the Follow on Shop button in one of the following ways:
 Install the Shop sales channel and activate Shopify Payments test mode.
 Contact Partner Support to request a Follow on Shop beta flag for your test store. A beta flag bypasses store settings.

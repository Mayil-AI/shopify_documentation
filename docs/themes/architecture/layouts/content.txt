 Layouts
 Layouts are the base of the theme, through which all templates are rendered.
 Layouts are Liquid files that allow you to include content, that should be repeated on multiple page types, in a single location. For example, layouts are a good place to include any content you might want in your <head> element, as well as headers and footers.
 You can edit the default theme.liquid layout, or you can create multiple custom layout files to suit your needs. You can specify which layout to use, or whether to use a layout at all, at the template level:
 In JSON templates, the layout that's used to render a page is specified using the layout attribute.
 In Liquid templates, the layout that's used to render a page is specified using the layout Liquid tag.
 Location
 Layout files are located in the layout directory of the theme:
 1 └── theme
 2
      ├── layout
 3
      |   ├── theme.liquid
 4
      |   ...
 5
      ├── templates
 6
      ...
 Subtypes
 There are the following layout types:
 Type Description
 General General layouts can apply to all non-checkout pages.
 
 The default layout file, which must be included in all themes, is theme.liquid.
 Checkout This layout type applies to all checkout pages. It's available to Shopify Plus merchants only.
 
 To learn more about this layout, refer to checkout.liquid.
 Schema
 Because layout files are the base of the theme, they should follow the structure of a standard HTML document in most cases. Most layout files also contain the following Liquid objects:
 content_for_header
 content_for_layout
 basic_layout_example.liquid
 1 <!DOCTYPE html>
 2 <html>
 3
    <head>
 4
      ...
 5
      {{ content_for_header }}
 6
      ...
 7
    </head>
 8
 9
    <body>
 10
      ...
 11
      {{ content_for_layout }}
 12
      ...
 13
    </body>
 14
   </html>
 Content
 Layouts allow you to include content that's repeated across multiple page types in a single location. For example, layouts might include header and footer sections and SEO metadata.
 Layout files are .liquid files, so content can be built using standard HTML and Liquid.
 Layouts can access any global Liquid objects and can contain the following Liquid objects:
 content_for_header
 content_for_layout.
 Caution
 These objects are required in theme.liquid. If references to these objects aren't included, then you can't save or update the file using the code editor or tools like Shopify CLI.
 content_for_header
 The content_for_header object is required in theme.liquid. It must be placed inside the HTML <head> tag. It dynamically loads all scripts required by Shopify into the document head. These scripts are required for features like reCAPTCHA, Shopify apps, and more.
 You shouldn't try to modify or parse the content_for_header object. If content_for_header changes, then the behavior of your Liquid will change.
 content_for_layout
 The content_for_layout object dynamically outputs the content for each template. You need to add a reference to this object between the <body> and </body> HTML tags.
 Usage
 When working with layout files, you should familiarize yourself with the following concepts:
 Supporting template-specific CSS selectors
 Accessing and customizing checkout.liquid
 Support template-specific CSS selectors
 You can help create CSS rules for specific templates by outputting data from the template object in the <body> tag’s class.
 Template-specific CSS selector
 theme.liquid
 1 <body class="template-{{ template.name }}">
 2
    ...
 3 </body>
 theme.css
 1 .template-product {
 2
    margin-bottom: 2em;
 3 }
 Access and customize checkout.liquid
 Deprecated
 checkout.liquid is deprecated. It will be sunset for the Information, Shipping, and Payment checkout steps on August 13, 2024, and for the Thank you and Order status pages on August 28, 2025. Additional scripts and script tags will also be sunset for the Order status page on August 28, 2025.

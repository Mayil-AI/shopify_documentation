 Dynamic sources
 Settings for sections and blocks included in a JSON template have the option for merchants to connect one or more dynamic sources to the setting, depending on the setting type.
 A dynamic source can be either:
 A metafield value
 A resource attribute
 Note
 Dynamic sources aren't available for general theme settings.
 Available values
 Shopify determines the value of each available dynamic source type based on the following:
 The resource associated with the template that the section is in
 The resource settings in the context of the current setting
 For example:

 Referencing metaobject fields
 You can use dynamic sources to connect metaobject fields to settings. The metaobject must be referenced in a metaobject_reference metafield.
 When the user selects the metaobject_reference metafield, they're prompted to select the field that they want to display. Users can select metaobject fields in any settings that support the field's type.
 In the case of a list.metaobject_reference, the metaobject entries attached to the resource are iterated over, and for each metaobject, the selected field's value is displayed in a list. The values are displayed as a list of the selected field's type. For example, if the selected metaobject field is of type single_line_text_field, then the values are returned as list.single_line_text_field.
 EXAMPLE
 A merchant has a list.metaobject_reference metafield that references a Materials metaobject. Each metaobject has a field called Material name.
 You can assign the materials by name to the product in the Metafields section:
 In the online store editor, any setting that supports list.single_line_text_field, such as a rich text field, can use dynamic sources to select the Material name field as a text source:
 This outputs a list of the material names associated with the current product:
 Default values
 You can configure a setting's default value to reference a dynamic source. However, only do this if you're rendering a section or block in a context where the dynamic source value exists. For example, don't use a product-related value in a section that:
 Can be rendered in non-product templates
 Doesn't explicitly have a product type setting to provide the necessary value
 Note
 This also applies to setting values in presets.
 Additional Liquid is invalid when using this method, so you can only reference the value directly. If you include additional Liquid, then you'll get an error.
 The following is an example of a default setting that references a dynamic source:
 1 {
 2
    "type": "text",
 3
    "id": "featured_product_title",
 4
    "label": "Featured product title",
 5
    "default": "Featuring: {{ product.title }}"
 6 }
 Limits
 Shopify limits the number of dynamic sources that you can use in different areas of your theme. These limits help to keep the theme performant.
 Dynamic sources limits
 Description Limit
 Dynamic sources in a JSON template 100
 Dynamic sources in general theme settings 100
 Dynamic sources in a section group 100
 Dynamic sources in a single setting 50
 Dynamic sources in a static section 50

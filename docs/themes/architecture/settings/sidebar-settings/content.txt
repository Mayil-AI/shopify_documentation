 Sidebar settings
 Sidebar settings can’t hold a value and aren’t configurable. They’re informational elements that can be used to provide detail around your input settings and organize them.
 Sidebar settings are composed of standard attributes. The following are the types of sidebar settings:
 header
 paragraph
 Tip
 If you want to add input settings, like a checkbox, then refer to Input settings.
 Standard attributes
 The following are standard attributes across sidebar settings:
 Attribute Description Required
 type The input setting type, which can be either header or paragraph. Yes
 content The setting content, which will show in the theme editor. Yes
 header
 A setting of type header outputs a header element to help you better organize your input settings. In addition to the standard attributes of a sidebar setting, header type settings have the following attribute:
 Attribute Description Required
 info An option for informational text about the setting. No
 For example, the following setting generates the following output:
 1 {
 2
    "type": "header",
 3
    "content": "Email Signup",
 4
    "info": "Subscribers added automatically to your “accepted marketing” customer list. [Learn more](https://help.shopify.com/manual/customers/manage-customers)"
 5 }
 Output
 paragraph
 A setting of type paragraph outputs a text element to help you better describe your input settings. For example, the following setting generates the following output:
 1 {
 2
    "type": "paragraph",
 3
    "content": "All of your collections are listed by default. To customize your list, choose 'Selected' and add collections."
 4 }

 Create links
 You can add links to the info settings attribute by enclosing the link text in brackets and then following it immediately with the URL in parentheses.
 For example, the following setting generates the following output:
 Settings
 1 {
 2
    "type": "checkbox",
 3
    "id": "enable_payment_button",
 4
    "label": "Show dynamic checkout button",
 5
    "info": "Each customer will see their preferred payment method from those available on your store, such as PayPal or Apple Pay. [Learn more](https://help.shopify.com/manual/online-store/dynamic-checkout)",

    "default": true
 7 },

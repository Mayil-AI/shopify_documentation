gift_card.liquid
 The gift_card.liquid template renders the gift card page, which displays the gift card issued to a customer upon purchase.
 Tip
 Refer to the gift_card.liquid template in Dawn for an example of this template.
 Unlike other pages in your store, gift card pages are hosted on the checkout.shopify.com domain. Gift card URLs contain unique identifiers for your store and gift card:
 1 https://checkout.shopify.com/gift_cards/[store_id]/[gift_card_token]
 The following image is an example of how Dawn's gift_card.liquid template renders the gift card page.

      <img id="apple-wallet-badge"

 6
        height="40"

 Display only the gift card details
 If you don’t want to include theme elements, like the header and footer, you can choose to render the gift_card.liquid template with no layout or with a custom layout, using the Liquid layout object.
 For example:
 gift_card.liquid
 1 {% layout none %}
 2
 3 <!-- template content -->
 Preview the template
 You can preview the gift card's appearance by navigating to the gift card template from the theme editor.
 From the theme editor, open the drop-down menu at the top of the page.
 Under Templates, click Others. Then click Gift card.
 Note
 If you can't find the gift card template in the theme editor's navigation menu, then you might need to insert the content_for_header Liquid object in the HTML <head> tag of your gift_card.liquid template.

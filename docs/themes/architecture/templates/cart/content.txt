cart
 The cart template renders the /cart page, which provides an overview of the contents of a customer’s cart. The overview is typically shown in a table format with a row for each line item.
 Tip
 Refer to the cart template, its items section, and its footer section in Dawn for an example implementation.
 Location
 The cart template is located in the templates directory of the theme:
 1 └── theme
 2
      ├── layout
 3
      ├── templates
 4
      |   ...
 5
      |   ├── cart.json
 You should include the cart object in your cart template or a section inside of the template.
 The cart object
 You can access the Liquid cart object to display the cart details.
 Usage
 When working with the cart template, you should familiarize yourself with the following:
 Using cart line items
 Letting customers proceed to checkout from the cart
 Providing an option to remove line items from the cart
 Updating line item quantities
 Showing discounts
 Using cart notes and attributes
 Displaying line item properties in the cart
 Tip
 If you're using a JSON template, then any HTML or Liquid code needs to be included in a section that's referenced by the template.
 Cart line items
 A line_item is a single line in a shopping cart that records which variant of a product was added, and the associated quantity. For example, if a customer adds both a size medium and size large of the same t-shirt to their cart, then each t-shirt has its own line item.
 The cart template should include a table where each line item has a row:
 Example
 1 {% for item in cart.items %}
 2
    <!-- line item info -->
 3 {% endfor %}
 Proceed to checkout
 To let customers proceed to checkout from the cart, you need to output the cart line items inside a <form> element. The form element needs to have attributes of action="{{ routes.cart_url }}" and method="post".
 The form element also needs to include an <input> with attributes of type="submit" and name="checkout". This input triggers proceeding to checkout.
 Example
 1 <form action="{{ routes.cart_url }}" method="post">
 2
    {% for item in cart.items %}
 3
      <!-- line item info -->
 4
    {% endfor %}
 5
 6
    <input type="submit" name="checkout" value="Checkout">
 7 </form>
 Remove line items from the cart
 You should give customers the option to remove a line item from their cart. You can do this by including an <a> element with each line item, whose href attribute references the url_to_remove attribute of the line_item object:
 Example
 1 {% for item in cart.items %}
 2
    <!-- line item info -->
 3
 4
    <a href="{{ item.url_to_remove }}">Remove</a>
 5 {% endfor %}
 Tip
 Refer to the Cart API to learn more about changing the cart using JavaScript.
 Update line item quantities
 You should give customers the option to update line item quantities in their cart. You can do this by including an <input> element with each line item that has the attributes of name="updates[]" and value="":
 Example
 1 {% for item in cart.items %}
 2
    <!-- line item info -->
 3
 4
    <input type="text" name="updates[]" value="{{ item.quantity }}">
 5 {% endfor %}
 To actually trigger an update when a quantity input is changed, you can include an <input> with an attribute of type="submit" in the cart <form>:
 Example
 1 <input type="submit" value="Update cart">
 Submitting the form with this input will reload the page with updated quantities.
 Tip
 Refer to the /{locale}/cart/update endpoint of the Cart API to learn more about updating the cart using JavaScript.
 Show cart and line item discounts
 Because discounts can apply to an entire cart or to individual line items, you should show discounts with the cart total summary and individual line item displays. To learn more about discounts and how to build discount displays, refer to Discounts.
 Support cart notes and attributes
 You can give customers the option to include additional information with their order through cart notes and attributes.
 Cart notes
 To capture a cart note, include an HTML input, commonly a <textarea>, with the attributes name="note" and form="cart" in the main-cart-footer.liquid file:
 main-cart-footer.liquid
 1 <textarea name="note" form="cart"></textarea>
 This value is accessible through the note attribute of the cart object.
 Cart attributes
 To capture a cart attribute, include an HTML input with the attributes name="attributes[attribute-name]" and form="cart" in the main-cart-footer.liquid file:
 main-cart-footer.liquid
 1 <p>
 2
    <label>Please let us know your favorite color</label>
 3
 4
    <input type="text" name="attributes[Favorite color]" form="cart" value="{{ cart.attributes['Favorite color'] }}">
 5 </p>
 Any values are accessible through the attributes attribute of the cart object.
 Display line item properties
 When items are added to the cart, they can have line item properties included with them. You can display these properties on the cart page by looping through each property:
 Example
 1 {% for item in cart.items %}
 2
    <!-- line item info -->
 3
 4
    {% unless item.properties == empty %}
 5
      {% for property in item.properties %}
 6
        {{ property.first }}:
 7
 8
        {% if property.last contains '/uploads/' %}
 9
          <a href="{{ property.last }}">{{ property.last | split: '/' | last }}</a>
 10
        {% else %}
 11
          {{ property.last }}
 12
        {% endif %}
 13
      {% endfor %}
 14
    {% endunless %}
 15 {% endfor %}
 Tip
 If two of the same item are added to the cart, but have unique line item properties, then they’ll be split into separate line items.

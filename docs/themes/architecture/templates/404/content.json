404
 The 404 template renders page content that is shown to customers if they enter an invalid URL for the store.
 Tip
 Refer to the 404 template and its main section in Dawn for an example implementation.
 Location
 The 404 template is located in the templates directory of the theme:
 1 └── theme
 2
      ├── layout
 3
      ├── templates
 4
      |   ...
 5
      |   ├── 404.json
 There are no suggested objects for a 404 template. However, the template should make it clear to the customer that the page they were looking for couldn’t be found.
 You should provide obvious options for how to proceed. For example, you can add links to popular pages, a search bar to help customers find what they’re looking for, or a link that redirects customers to your home page or a collection to continue shopping:
 1 <p>
 2
      404
 3
    </p>
 4
    <h1 class="title">
 5
      Page not found
 6
    </h1>
 7
    <a href="{{ routes.all_products_collection_url }}" class="button">
 8
      Continue shopping
 9
    </a>
 Tip
 If you're using a JSON template, then any HTML or Liquid code needs to be included in a section that's referenced by the template.

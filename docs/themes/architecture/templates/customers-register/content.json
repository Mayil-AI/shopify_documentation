customers/register
 The customers/register template renders the customer register page, which hosts the form for customer account creation.
 Tip
 Refer to the customers/register template and its main section in Dawn for an example implementation.
 Location
 The customers/register template is located in the templates > customers directory of the theme:
 1 └── theme
 2
      ├── layout
 3
      ├── templates
 4
      |   └── customers
 5
      |     ├── register.json
 You should include the customer register form in your customers/register template or a section inside of the template.
 Tip
 If you're using a JSON template, then any HTML or Liquid code needs to be included in a section that's referenced by the template.
 The customer register form
 The customer register form can be added with the Liquid form tag and accompanying 'create_customer' parameter. Within the form tag block, you need to include the following:
 Input type name
 First name text customer[first_name]
 Last name text customer[last_name]
 Email email customer[email]
 Password password customer[password]
 For example:
 1 {% form 'create_customer' %}
 2
    {{ form.errors | default_errors }}
 3
 4
    <div class="first-name">
 5
      <label for="first-name">First name</label>
 6
      <input type="text" name="customer[first_name]">
 7
    </div>
 8

    <div class="last-name">

      <label for="last-name">Last name</label>

      <input type="text" name="customer[last_name]">

    </div>

    <div class="email">

      <label for="email">Email</label>

    </div>

    <div class="password">

      <label for="password">Password</label>
 21
      <input type="password" name="customer[password]">
 22
    </div>

    <div class="submit">

 Usage
 When working with the customers/register template, you should familiarize yourself with redirecting customers on account creation.
 Redirect customers on account creation
 By default, when a customer creates an account, they're directed to the home page. However, you can specify a page to direct customers to using the return_to parameter of the Liquid form tag.
 For example, the following directs customers to the all-products collection page:
 1 {% form 'create_customer', return_to: routes.all_products_collection_url %}
 2
    <!-- form content -->
 3 {% endform %}

password
 The password template renders the password page, which is a landing page that's shown when password protection is applied to a store. This page includes a message that is editable by merchants, and the password form for customers to gain access to the store.
 Tip
 Refer to the password template and its sections in Dawn for an example implementation.
 Location
 The password template is located in the templates directory of the theme:
 1 └── theme
 2
      ├── layout
 3
      ├── templates
 4
      |   ...
 5
      |   ├── password.json
 You can include the following in your password template or a section inside of the template:
 A password message
 The password form
 The email sign-up form
 Tip
 If you're using a JSON template, then any HTML or Liquid code needs to be included in a section that's referenced by the template.
 The password message
 When password protection is enabled on a store, there's also the option to include a message. This message can be shown using the password_message attribute of the Liquid shop object:
 Example
 1 {% unless shop.password_message == blank %}
 2
    {{ shop.password_message }}
 3 {% endunless %}
 The password form
 The password form can be added with the Liquid form tag and accompanying 'storefront_password' parameter. Within the form tag block, you need to include an <input> with the following attributes:
 type="password"
 name="password"
 For example:
 1 {% form 'storefront_password' %}
 2
    {{ form.errors | default_errors }}
 3
 4
    <div class="password">
 5
      <label for="password">Password</label>
 6
      <input type="password" name="password">
 7
    </div>
 8
 9
    <div class="submit">
 10
      <input type="submit" value="Sign in">
 11
    </div>
 12 {% endform %}
 The email sign-up form
 You can include an email sign-up form, to capture customer emails, with the Liquid form tag and accompanying 'customer' parameter. Within the form tag block, you need to include the following:
 Input type name value
 Tags hidden contact[tags] prospect, password page
 Email email contact[email] -
 For example:
 1 {% form 'customer' %}
 2
    {{ form.errors | default_errors }}
 3
 4
    <div class="tags">
 5
      <input type="hidden" name="contact[tags]">
 6
    </div>
 7
 8
    <div class="email">
 9
      <label for="email">Email</label>
 10
      <input type="email" name="contact[email]">
 11
    </div>
 12
 13
    <div class="submit">
 14
      <input type="submit" value="Sign in">
 15
    </div>
 16 {% endform %}
 Tip
 Shopify assists merchants in marketing to customers created with the prospect and password page tags, but you can use your own custom tags as well.
 Usage
 If you're working on a development store, then you can't show a custom password page on the store. A development store-specific password page is always displayed.
 Although the customizable password page isn't used to control access to your development store, you can still view it after you log in, or edit it from the Shopify admin.
 To view the customizable password page, logged-in visitors can navigate to https://your-store-name.myshopify.com/password, where your-store-name is the name of the development store.

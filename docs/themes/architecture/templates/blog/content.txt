blog
 The blog template renders the blog page, which lists all articles within a blog.
 Tip
 Refer to the blog template and its main section in Dawn for an example implementation.
 Location
 The blog template is located in the templates directory of the theme:
 1 └── theme
 2
      ├── layout
 3
      ├── templates
 4
      |   ...
 5
      |   ├── blog.json
 Your blog template should contain a section that includes the blog object.
 The blog object
 You can access the Liquid blog object to display the blog details.
 Usage
 When working with the blog template, you should familiarize yourself with filtering articles by tag.
 Tip
 If you're using a JSON template, then any HTML or Liquid code needs to be included in a section that's referenced by the template.
 Filter articles by tag
 You can use article tags to filter a blog into smaller subsets of articles. This is done by appending /tagged/[tag-handle] to the blog URL, where [tag-handle] is the handleized version of the desired article tag.
 For example, if you want to show only articles from the main blog that are tagged with news, then you can use the following URL structure:
 1 https://my-store.myshopify.com/blogs/main/tagged/news
 You can also filter by multiple tags by combining the handleized tags with a +:
 1 https://my-store.myshopify.com/blogs/main/tagged/news+breaking
 Tip
 Instead of manually building this URL structure, you can use the link_to_tag, link_to_add_tag, and link_to_remove_tag URL filters.

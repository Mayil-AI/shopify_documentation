customers/reset_password
 The customers/reset_password template renders the password reset page, which hosts the form to reset the password for a customer account.
 Tip
 Refer to the customers/reset_password template and its main section in Dawn for an example implementation.
 Location
 The customers/reset_password template is located in the templates > customers directory of the theme:
 1 └── theme
 2
      ├── layout

      ├── templates

      |   └── customers

      |     ├── reset_password.json
 You should include the password reset form in your customers/account template or a section inside of the template.
 Tip
 If you're using a JSON template, then any HTML or Liquid code needs to be included in a section that's referenced by the template.
 The password reset form
 The password reset form can be added with the Liquid form tag and accompanying 'reset_customer_password' parameter. Within the form tag block, you need to include the following:
 Input type name
 Password password customer[password]
 Password confirmation password customer[password_confirmation]
 For example:
 1 {%- form 'reset_customer_password' -%}
 2
    {{ form.errors | default_errors }}

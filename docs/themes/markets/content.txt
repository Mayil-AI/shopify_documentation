 Shopify Markets
 Shopify helps merchants expand their business to a global audience, sell to multiple countries, and scale internationally. This means that many merchants need to sell in multiple languages and currencies.
 To support this, Shopify has the Geolocation app, which detects a customer's location and enables them to choose a currency, a language, or both. Alternatively, you can create country and language selectors to enable customers to choose their preferred options.
 Additionally, you can adapt your theme content for different markets.

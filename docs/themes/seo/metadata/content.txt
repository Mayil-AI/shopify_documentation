 Add SEO metadata to your theme
 You can include search engine optimization (SEO) metadata in your theme using HTML and Liquid. There are three main aspects to consider:
 The title tag
 The meta description
 Canonical URLs
 The code for the above SEO metadata should be included in the <head> element.
 For example:
 layouts/theme.liquid
 1 <head>
 2
    <title>
 3
      {{ page_title -}}
 4
      {%- if current_tags %} &ndash; tagged "{{ current_tags | join: ', ' }}"{% endif -%}
 5
      {%- if current_page != 1 %} &ndash; Page {{ current_page }}{% endif -%}
 6
      {%- unless page_title contains shop.name %} &ndash; {{ shop.name }}{% endunless -%}
 7
    </title>
 8
 9
    {% if page_description %}
 10
      <meta name="description" content="{{ page_description | escape }}" />
 11
    {% endif %}
 12
 13
    <link rel="canonical" href="{{ canonical_url }}" />
 14 </head>
 Tip
 For another example of including metadata in a theme, you can refer to Dawn's implementation.
 The title tag
 You can include a <title> element for search engines to read the page title from. The title for most pages can be set in the admin, and you can access this title with the Liquid page_title object.
 The meta description
 You can include a <meta> element for search engines to read the page description from. The description for most pages can be set in the admin, and you can access this description with the Liquid page_description object.
 Canonical URLs
 You can specify a canonical URL for a given page using the global Liquid canonical_url object.

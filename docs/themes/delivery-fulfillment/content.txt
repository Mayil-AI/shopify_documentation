 Delivery and fulfillment
 A big hurdle for merchants is getting customers to make a purchase, however once that purchase is made, they still need a way for the product to reach the customer. The most common method is shipping, however Shopify also provides merchants the option to offer products for local pickup.
 As such, you can show the pickup availability on product pages so customers can see whether this is an option for their desired product.

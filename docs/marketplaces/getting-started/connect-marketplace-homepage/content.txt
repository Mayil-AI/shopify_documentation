 Connecting your marketplace homepage to merchant stores
 Caution
 The merchant-facing sales channel app referenced in this tutorial isn't compatible with Shopify CLI 3, and can't be previewed using Shopify development tools. You can use the app and these tutorials as reference material to build a CLI 3-compatible app using the same patterns.
 Tip
 Marketplace Kit tutorials require you to have a buyer-facing marketplace in place. If you don't have one, then you can clone code for a buyer-facing app as a springboard to get you started.
 What you'll learn
 After finishing this tutorial, you'll know how to do the following:
 Connect your existing marketplace to merchants' stores
 Requirements
 You have a buyer-facing marketplace.
 You've completed the tutorial for creating a channel app experience.
 Step 1: Connect to a merchant's store
 Connect to a merchant's store using the following URI and headers. The domain and storefrontAccessToken are taken from your database.
 1 const client = new ApolloClient({
 2
    uri: `https://${domain}/api/2024-04/graphql.json`,
 3
    headers: {
 4
      "X-Shopify-Storefront-Access-Token": storefrontAccessToken,
 5
    },
 6
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
 7
    });
 8
    const { data } = await client.query({
 9
    query: SHOP_PRODUCTS_QUERY,
 10
    });
 11
    setData(data);
 Step 2: Retrieve data
 Use a GraphQL query to retrieve the list of products that the merchant has published to your channel app.
 For example, the following query retrieves basic shop details and the first four products:
 GraphQL query
 1 import { gql } from "apollo-boost";
 2
 3 const SHOP_PRODUCTS_QUERY = gql`
 4
    query ShopProducts {
 5
      shop {
 6
        name
 7
        primaryDomain {
 8
          url
 9
        }
 10
      }
 11
      products(first: 4) {
 12
        edges {
 13
          node {
 14
            id
 15
            title
 16
            images(first: 1) {
 17
              edges {
 18
                node {
 19
                  id
 20
                  altText
 21
                  originalSrc
 22
                }
 23
              }
 24
            }
 25
            priceRange {
 26
              minVariantPrice {
 27
                amount
 28
                currencyCode
 29
              }
 30
              maxVariantPrice {
 31
                amount
 32
                currencyCode
 33
              }
 34
            }
 35
            onlineStoreUrl
 36
          }
 37
        }
 38
      }
 39
    }

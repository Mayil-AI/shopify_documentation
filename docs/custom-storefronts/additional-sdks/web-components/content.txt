 Web Components
 Web Components are a collection of web standards that allow the creation of components that act as standard elements. Web Components encapsulate their style and HTML and are supported by all modern browsers. You can use components as you would use a <div> or <input>, and can also integrate them with any JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML.
 You can use Web Components provided by Shopify to embed certain user interface (UI) components.
 Note
 Some of Shopify's Web Components haven't been tested on IE11.
 Buy with Shop Pay component
 The Buy with Shop Pay component allows you to integrate a Shop Pay button on any website for one or more preconfigured products. It directs the buyer to an accelerated buy-it-now checkout flow. Buyers who are already signed in with Shop Pay can review their order and confirm in a single tap. The component uses the Checkout Links functionality and adheres to the Shop Pay branding guidelines.

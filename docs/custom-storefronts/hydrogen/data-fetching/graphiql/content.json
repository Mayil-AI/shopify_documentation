 Hydrogen API reference
 GraphiQL explorer
 For convenience, Hydrogen includes a local GraphiQL explorer to help you create queries and learn about Shopify's Storefront API.
 Requirements
 Make sure you have the following environment variables in place:
 PUBLIC_STORE_DOMAIN
 PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_API_VERSION
 PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN
 GraphiQL
 The GraphiQL interface is available by default when running the Hydrogen CLI in development mode.
 Terminal
 npm
 Yarn
 pnpm
 $ npx shopify hydrogen dev
 With the development server running, go to /graphiql in your browser.
 If you're not using the Hydrogen CLI, or want to customize the GraphiQL interface, you can do so by creating a graphiql route in your project:
 Optional route for GraphiQL
 JavaScript
 TypeScript
 <root>/app/routes/graphiql.jsx
 1 import {graphiqlLoader} from '@shopify/hydrogen';
 2 import {redirect} from '@shopify/remix-oxygen';
 3
 4 export async function loader(args) {
 5
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
 6
      // Default Hydrogen GraphiQL behavior
 7
      return graphiqlLoader(args);
 8
    }
 9
 10
    return redirect('/');
 11 }
 Note
 If youâ€™re creating your own graphiql route, then make sure it's not available in production. You can use process.env.NODE_ENV to enforce tree-shaking.

 Read data from a cart
 This guide shows you how to read a user's cart.
 Requirements
 You've completed the quickstart guide.
 You've set up a cart handler.
 Step 1: Get a visitor's cart
 Use the cart, created from createCartHandler, to get a user's cart. You don't need to provide a cart ID because it's already handled by the cart handler. cart.get() returns a promise. Use Remix's defer so that the cart data is deferred, and streamed to the browser.
 File
 JavaScript
 TypeScript
 /app/root.jsx
 1 export async function loader({context}) {
 2
    const {cart} = context;
 3
 4
    return defer({
 5
      cart: cart.get(),
 6
    });
 7 }
 Step 2: Server render the content of the cart
 You can get the content of the cart using Remix's useMatches hook, because you made it available in the root loader. Since the data is deferred, you'll need to wait for the data.
 File
 JavaScript
 TypeScript
 /app/components/CartDrawer.jsx
 1 function CartDrawer() {
 2
    const [root] = useMatches();
 3
 4
    // Cart data is deferred
 5
    // Use Suspense to unblock UI rendering and Await to resolve when data arrives
 6
    return (
 7
      <Suspense fallback={<CartLoading />}>
 8
        <Await resolve={root.data?.cart}>
 9
          {(cart) => <Cart cart={cart} />}
 10
        </Await>
 11
      </Suspense>
 12
    );
 13 }

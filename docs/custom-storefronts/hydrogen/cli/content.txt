 Hydrogen CLI
 Hydrogen includes a built-in command-line interface for creating, developing, and managing Hydrogen storefronts. The Hydrogen CLI is a plugin that extends the Shopify CLI.
 Requirements
 Node.js v16.13+
 npm v8.1.2+
 When you create a new Hydrogen project, the Hydrogen CLI is automatically included as a project dependency.
 Command reference
 The Hydrogen CLI is installed as a local dependency for your project, so you should always run Hydrogen commands in your project using npx:
 1 npx shopify hydrogen <command>
 Run the shortcut command to create a global h2 alias for npx shopify hydrogen. This lets you run Hydrogen commands with fewer keystrokes:
 1 h2 <command>

 check Returns diagnostic information about a Hydrogen storefront.
 codegen Automatically generates GraphQL types for your project’s Storefront API queries.

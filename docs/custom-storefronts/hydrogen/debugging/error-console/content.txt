 Error console
 The error console helps you debug server errors in Hydrogen code deployed to Oxygen.
 Accessing the error console
 The error console is available to apps deployed to Oxygen. To open the error console for a deployment, click on any error in the runtime log on its deployment detail page. The error console highlights the line that caused a server error and allows you to explore the complete source code of the deployed worker bundle.
 The error console and stack trace within it require a source map file to be generated along with your worker bundle. The Hydrogen CLI generates the source map file by default when you run the build command.
 Raw stack traces
 Prettified source maps can occasionally be inaccurate. If the formatted stack trace doesn't work, then you can inspect the raw stack trace for more detail about the error. To view a raw stack trace, do the following:
 On the deployment detail page, click the error you want to inspect.
 In the Stack trace panel, click Raw traces.
 Download the worker bundle and use the raw stack trace to dig deeper into the problem.
 Disabling source maps
 You can disable source maps by passing the --no-sourcemap flag when running the build command. Doing so means you won't have access to the error console or stack traces in your runtime logs.
 Terminal
 $ npx shopify hydrogen build --no-sourcemap

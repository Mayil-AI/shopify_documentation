 End-to-end testing
 Learn how to run end-to-end tests against your deployment in your CI/CD workflow by creating an authentication bypass token.
 Step 1: Generate the authentication bypass token
 Note
 This guide uses the Hydrogen CLI to deploy code to the Oxygen Platform. This supersedes the previously used shopify/oxygenctl-action command.
 Generate a Hydrogen deployment token in the Shopify admin.
 Modify your CI/CD file to include the deploy command.
 1 npx shopify hydrogen deploy --auth-bypass-token --token $SHOPIFY_HYDROGEN_DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN
 The command outputs a file named h2_deploy_log.json, which contains the deployment URL and the authentication bypass token that you can feed into your end-to-end testing system. Each token remains valid for two hours.
 Example GitHub workflow
 If you're using GitHub workflow files, then edit the deploy step per the following example. If you're using another CI/CD system, then refer to these example workflows.

            export DEPLOYMENT_URL=$(jq -r '.url' h2_deploy_log.json)
 16
            npm run e2e-test
 Refer to a live example on our Hydrogen demo store.
 Step 2: Embed the authentication bypass token in the request header
 Your end-to-end testing system must embed the token within the header before navigating to the deployment URL.
 1 oxygen-auth-bypass-token: <auth-bypass-token>

 Go live with Hydrogen and Oxygen
 This guide prepares you to go live with a Hydrogen storefront that's hosted on Oxygen.
 Load testing
 If you plan to load test your build before launch, then our anti-bot System might recognize your load test system as bot traffic and throttle it. To coordinate a scheduled load test, connect with your Merchant Success Manager or Shopify Support three to five weeks in advance of your go live date.
 Shopify analytics
 To ensure that Shopify analytics are working properly, follow our set up guide
 Manage Shopify Scripts
 If you're using Shopify Scripts, then you might need to unpublish and republish them and ensure that they're available to the Storefront API.
 Update Meta & Google product feeds
 If you're using Meta & Google apps for your product feeds for advertising, then you'll need to update those catalogs to use your Hydrogen storefront's domain. You can do this either using a third-party tool instead of the standard Facebook and Google sales channels, or by setting up feed rules. For more information, refer to Facebook, and Google documentation.
 Redirect previous order status pages
 If your online store has active orders before you launch your Hydrogen storefront, then redirect customers to avoid 404 responses.
 Next Steps
 Take live traffic with Redirect traffic to the Hydrogen channel to publish the new Hydrogen storefront.

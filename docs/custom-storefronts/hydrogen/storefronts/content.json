 Storefronts
 The Hydrogen channel allows you to create multiple storefronts. Each storefront is linked to a single Hydrogen app, connected through a GitHub repository.
 Storefronts can have multiple environments, which contain deployments.
 Create a new storefront by connecting an existing GitHub repository
 If you already created a Hydrogen app and pushed it to GitHub, then you can connect that repo to a new Hydrogen storefront.
 In the Hydrogen channel, click Create storefront.
 Click Connect existing repository.
 Under Account, select the GitHub account or organization that contains the Hydrogen repo.
 Under Repository, select the repo.
 Click Connect.
 After connecting the repo, Shopify automatically opens a pull request to add an Oxygen deployment workflow file. Merge the PR to start continuous deployment to Oxygen.

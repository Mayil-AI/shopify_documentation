 How it works
 Shopify provides a suite of libraries that enable developers to deliver best-in-class, mobile app commerce experiences for buyers: build custom storefront and product discovery flows, integrate identity with sign-in and account management, and accelerate buyers through a contextual and personalized checkout process.
 Storefront
 Shopify’s Mobile Buy SDK’s enable you to create and embed custom storefront and product discovery experiences within your mobile app. The SDK’s interface with the GraphQL Storefront API to fetch information about products and collections, and to assemble a personalized buyer cart with contextual buyer information.
 iOS Buy SDK
 Create custom storefronts and assemble carts within an iOS app.
 Android Buy SDK
 Create custom storefronts and assemble carts within an Android app.
 Buyer identity
 The best shopping experiences are buyer and context aware, enabling relevant personalization of product, payment, and other preferences in product discovery, checkout, and post-purchase workflows. Shopify provides support for built-in identity solutions, integrations with third-party identity providers, and cart-driven workflows for optimizing guest and new buyer checkout journeys.
 New Customer Accounts
 Authenticate buyers with a secure one-time code sent to an email address, with built-in support for Shop sign-in. Integrate via Customer API, SDK support coming in 2024.
 Classic Customer Accounts
 Authenticate buyers with classic customer account via username and password. Integrate via Storefront API or Buy SDK.
 Multipass
 Authenticate buyers with third-party identity and authentication system via Multipass protocol.
 Cart Buyer Identity
 Associate known identity and buyer preferences via cart to prefill and accelerate checkout.
 Checkout Sheet Kit
 Shopify’s Checkout Sheet Kit enables you to provide the world’s highest converting, customizable, one-page checkout directly within the native app. The experience is a fully-featured checkout that preserves all of the store customizations—e.g. branding settings, UI extensions, Functions, and more. It also provides platform idiomatic defaults such as support for light and dark mode, and developer APIs to embed, customize, and follow the lifecycle of the checkout experience.
 Checkout Sheet Kit for Swift
 A Swift library for presenting the Shopify checkout experience.
 Checkout Sheet Kit for Android
 An Android library for presenting the Shopify checkout experience.
 Checkout Sheet Kit for React Native
 A React Native module for presenting the Shopify checkout experience.
 Note
 The checkout experience is powered using embedded Shopify web checkout. The library implements a native bridge and protocol that abstracts all of the embedding logic behind simple-to-use native APIs with additional capabilities to pre-fill buyer identity, optimize how the checkout is loaded, how it is presented, and more. Check out our blog to learn how Checkout Sheet Kit is built.

 Network access GraphQL schema reference
 This guide describes the additional fields in the Function schemas that relate to network access. To retrieve the latest GraphQL schema, you can use a CLI command. Other Functions follow the same pattern.
 Function return types
 Function return types are specific to their associated target:
 FunctionFetchResult: The associated target is purchase.[function-name].fetch.
 FunctionRunResult: The associated target is purchase.[function-name].run.
 FunctionFetchResult
 The outcome of the purchase.[function-name].fetch target mutation is similar to other Function APIs and conveys an HttpRequest to be executed. The HttpRequest input contains traditional HTTP request fields.
 The HttpRequestPolicy field allows you to specify how Shopify should handle the request. Currently, you can only control the timeout execution. For more information, refer to Timeouts.

 FunctionRunResult
 The outcome of the purchase.[function-name].run target mutation. Refer to the API documentation for domain specific details.
 Input fetchResult
 The fetchResult input field is only available to the input query of the purchase.[function-name].run target and isn't available for the purchase.[function-name].fetch target. fetchResult represents the HttpResponse that derives from the HttpRequest.

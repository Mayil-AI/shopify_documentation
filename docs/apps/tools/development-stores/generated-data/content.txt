 Generated test data
 By default, Shopify stores are created empty, without any data. To speed up the development and testing process, you can create a development store that's populated with test data generated by Shopify.
 The generated test data set includes the most common commerce primitives and configurations that you need to test an app, theme, or custom storefront, including some Plus-specific features.
 This reference lists objects, configurations, and relationships that are included in the development store test data set.
 Caution
 Stores that start with generated test data can't be transferred to a merchant due to their unique configuration and the use of Shopify Plus features.
 Store configurations
 Stores that use generated test data have the following configurations:

 Standard metafield definitions
 Standard metafield definitions are metafield definitions that we've created for some common use cases. If you need to store data for one of these use cases, then we recommend using the standard metafield definitions, because they're interoperable across the entire Shopify platform and connect more seamlessly to themes.
 Standard metafield definition templates provide preset configurations to create metafield definitions. Each template has a specific namespace and key that we've reserved to have specific meanings for common use cases.
 Tip
 For more information about the types of information that metafield definitions can store, refer to Metafield types.

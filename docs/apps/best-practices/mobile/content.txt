 Mobile best practices for Shopify apps
 When you develop a mobile-first solution, consider the following mobile app best practices.
 Create responsive designs
 The app UI should adjust automatically to fit a smaller mobile screen to ensure a consistent experience on any device.
 Prioritize vertical scroll over horizontal scroll, and avoid using any horizontal scrolling elements if possible.
 Ensure core features are available
 The core functionality of the app or theme should be available using a mobile device.
 Apps should notify users when features are not available on mobile.
 Provide seamless setup
 Apps that require theme setup should use theme app extension app blocks and app embed blocks so that the user doesn’t need to manually make changes to their theme’s code.
 Configuration and onboarding should be easy to follow and primarily take place inside the app.
 Minimize the number of external web properties users are redirected to post installation.

 App performance best practices and guidelines
 Performance is an important factor for users when they choose apps. When you build an app, you should build with performance in mind.
 Optimizing your app for performance is key to the success of the users that you support and to the experiences of their customers. Performance directly influences conversion rates, repeat business, and search engine rankings.
 Performance and the Shopify App Store
 To be published in the Shopify App Store, your app must not reduce storefront Lighthouse performance scores by more than 10 points.
 Apps that don't significantly reduce storefront Lighthouse performance scores, and that meet all of the mandatory Shopify admin and Checkout performance criteria are eligible for Built for Shopify status. To qualify for Built for Shopify status, your app must not reduce Lighthouse performance scores by more than ten points, and must meet other applicable criteria.

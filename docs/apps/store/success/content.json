 Being successful in the Shopify App Store
 After your app is approved, by default it will be listed on the Shopify App Store. Shopify also features a selection of high-quality apps in places like the Shopify admin and on the homepage of the Shopify App Store.
 Hereâ€™s what you can do to help make sure your app is successful:
 Improve your app quality to become Built for Shopify. Apps that meet all of our criteria are eligible for Built for Shopify status. Along the way, you can qualify for smaller achievements that grant you more limited benefits, such as indicators of high quality on your app listing, special merchandising, or opportunities for promotion on various Shopify surfaces.
 Avoid prohibited actions to make sure your app continues to be listed on the Shopify App Store.
 Market your app through Shopify to reach merchants in the Shopify community.
 Market your app externally to find new users and grow your business.
 Use the Shopify App Store Ad Badge in your advertising and on social media to increase merchant confidence in your app.
 Send out a press release to announce the launch of your app.
 Manage reviews from merchants. Merchants can review your app in the Shopify App Store. Learn how to address feedback and work with negative reviews.
 Offer tech support for merchants who have issues or want to get more out of your app.
 Track usage of your app so that you have the data to help you make decisions and improvements.

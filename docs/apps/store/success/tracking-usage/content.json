 Track app usage metrics with the Partner Dashboard
 You can find detailed information about your apps' revenue, installations, and reviews on the Apps page in your Partner Dashboard. From there, you can see at a glance how each of your apps is performing, how merchants are using your apps, and how much revenue your apps have generated.
 View app analytics
 Analytics for each app appear on its Overview page in your Partner Dashboard.
 For data that includes a percentage change, the change compares data for the date range shown in the dashboard with the cumulative data prior to the start of that date range.
 For example, when you look at the number of app installs for the last 90 days, the percentage change compares the number of installs during the past 90 days to the total number of installs from the day that your app was created up to the start of that 90-day period. If your app was installed 1000 times during its first year, and then was installed 100 times during the following 90 days, then the percentage change for that 90-day period would be 10% (100/1000).

 Note
 The data in the dashboard might vary slightly from the data gathered by other reporting tools and services. For information on why the data can vary, see Report discrepancies.
 Earnings
 The earnings amount refers to how much an app developer has been paid. It includes both paid out amounts and pending payments, and it reflects the deduction of Shopify's revenue share and any application credits. Your share of the revenue is defined in the Shopify Partner revenue share agreement.
 Payments occur after a merchant has paid their Shopify invoice. The payment schedule depends on the type of charges made by the app:
 For a RecurringApplicationCharge, it can take up to 37 days from the time a merchant agrees to the charge to the time that the charge appears as an earning in your Partner Dashboard.
 For an ApplicationCharge, merchants are invoiced immediately and the charge will appear as an earning in your Partner Dashboard within 7 days.

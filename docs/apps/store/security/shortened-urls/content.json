 Shortened URLs
 Using shortened URLs
 URL shortening is a technique in which a long URL is shortened, usually by creating a shorter URL that will redirect to the long URL. This technique is commonly used to make a link more visually appealing or to hide the address. However, URL shortening is vulnerable to brute-force attacks. This means that attackers can programmatically enumerate on the set of possible shortened URLs, and access any valid URLs from the set.
 To ensure the security of Shopify merchant data, you should use high-entropy, non-guessable URLs at all times whether handling confidential or non-confidential data.
 If your app generates URLs that might hold confidential information, then you shouldn't use techniques to shorten the URL. This applies to any URLs that could pose a risk if compromised, including but not limited to:
 Checkout URLs
 Order URLs
 Other URLs that might include secret tokens or PII

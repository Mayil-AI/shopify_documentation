 Advertising in the Shopify App Store
 As an app developer, you can create ads to help merchants discover your apps in the Shopify App Store. Ads are shown to merchants on the Shopify App Store search results page above the organic search results, on the homepage, or on the category pages and subcategory pages in a Sponsored apps section. You can place bids on specific search terms, on the homepage, or on category pages so that your ads are shown when a merchant visits the homepage, specific category or subcategory pages, or searches for specific terms.
 Ads appear only on desktop. All ads are marked with a badge to show that they aren't organic app listings.
 Note
 App Store ads are available only to Shopify Partners. Shopify does not use App Store ads to advertise its own apps.
 To be eligible for ads, you must be compliant with the Shopify Partner Terms of Service, including any applicable commercial terms.

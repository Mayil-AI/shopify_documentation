 Webhook sub-topics
 Webhook sub-topics are an extra level of grouping available for some webhook topics. Sub-topics work with topics to enable delivery of a more specific and relevant stream of webhooks to your app.
 How it works
 When you subscribe to some webhook topics, your app can specify a sub-topic. Your app will then only receive webhooks for both the topic and sub-topic it subscribed to. Each topic uses its own scheme for allocating sub-topics. The following diagram illustrates the relationship between topics, sub-topics, webhooks, and subscriptions:
 GraphQL mutations
 Sub-topics are available in API version 2024-01 and higher. You can use the following GraphQL Admin API mutations to subscribe to a webhook with sub-topics:
 webhookSubscriptionCreate
 pubSubWebhookSubscriptionCreate
 eventBridgeWebhookSubscriptionCreate
 Topics with sub-topics
 The following topics support sub-topics.
 Metaobjects
 Topics: metaobjects/create, metaobjects/update, metaobjects/delete
 Sub-topics: Required
 Scheme: Sub-topics map to metaobject definitions
 Format: type:{type}, using the type of the metaobject definition
 Considerations:
 For app-owned metaobject definitions, you can't use the $app:{some-namespace} shorthand when specifying a sub-topic. Use the full type value, as it appears in query responses: app--{your-app-id}--{some-namespace}
 Limitations
 Sub-topics aren't supported in our webhook subscription REST API.

 Add the favicon
 You can use the GraphQL Admin API to add the favicon that displays at checkout, for a visual representation of your brand.
 Tip
 You can reset styles to their defaults by writing parent fields to null with the GraphQL Admin API. Refer to examples of resetting some and all values to the defaults.
 What you'll learn
 In this tutorial, you'll learn how to do the following tasks:
 Upload an image for the favicon that displays at checkout
 Retrieve a list of your store's checkout profile IDs
 Apply the favicon and view it in checkout
 Requirements
 The store that you're modifying must be on a Shopify Plus plan.
 You've created a new development store with the Checkout and Customer Accounts Extensibility developer preview enabled.
 You've completed the GraphQL and REST Admin API getting started guide.
 You've either installed the GraphiQL app on your store or created an app, with the read_checkout_branding_settings and write_checkout_branding_settings access scopes.
 You're using API version 2023-10 or higher.
 You're familiar with the GraphQL Admin API's branding types.
 Step 1: Upload the icon
 Customizing the checkout favicon requires you to first upload the icon to Shopify as a stagedUpload or your own hosting.
 Step 2: Create the file asset
 Make a request to the GraphQL Admin API's fileCreate mutation, passing an external URL or a staged upload URL as the originalSource. You'll use the id value when you add the image as the favicon.
 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json
 GraphQL mutation
 1 mutation fileCreate($files: [FileCreateInput!]!) {
 2
    fileCreate(files: $files) {
 3
      files {
 4
        id
 5
        alt
 6
        createdAt
 7
      }
 8
    }
 9 }
 Query variables
 1 {
 2
    "files": [
 3
      {
 4
        "alt": "Our logo, a leaf from the Monstera Deliciosa plant",
 5
        "filename": "favicon-image",
 6
        "originalSource": "https://{example}.com/custom-favicon-for-checkout"
 7
      }
 8
    ]
 3
      "fileCreate": {
 4
        "files": [
 5
          {
 6
            "id": "gid://shopify/MediaImage/34829967327254",
 7
            "alt": "Our logo, a leaf from the Monstera Deliciosa plant",
 8
            "filename": "favicon-image",
 9
            "createdAt": "2023-11-107T02:44:06Z"
 10
 13
    },
 14 }
 Step 3: Retrieve the store's checkout profile IDs
 Checkout styling properties apply to a checkout profile ID. In this step, you'll retrieve the checkout profile to which you'll apply favicon changes.
 Query checkoutProfiles to retrieve a list of checkout profile IDs.
 The is_published parameter indicates which checkout profile is currently applied to your store's live checkout.
 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json
 GraphQL query
 1 query checkoutProfiles {
 2
    checkoutProfiles(first: 1, query: "is_published:true") {
 3
      edges {
 4
        node {
 5
          id
 6
          name
    }
 10 }
 JSON response
 1 {
 2
    "data": {
 3
      "checkoutProfiles": {
 4
        "edges": [
              "id": "gid://shopify/CheckoutProfile/1",
 8
              "name": "Default checkout profile"
 9
            }
 10
          }
 11
        ]
 12
      }
 13
    }
 14 }
 Make note of your corresponding ID from the list. You'll supply the ID in subsequent mutations.
 Step 4: Set the favicon image
 Call the checkoutBrandingUpsert mutation, passing the mediaImageId. This is the id value that the fileCreate mutation returned.
 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json
 GraphQL mutation
 1 mutation checkoutBrandingUpsert($checkoutBrandingInput: CheckoutBrandingInput!, $checkoutProfileId: ID!) {
 2
    checkoutBrandingUpsert(
 3
      checkoutBrandingInput: $checkoutBrandingInput
 4
      checkoutProfileId: $checkoutProfileId
 5
    ) {
 6
      checkoutBranding {
 7
        customizations {
 8
          favicon {
 9
            image {
 10
              id
 11
            }
 12
          }
 13
        }
 14
      }
 15
      userErrors {
 16
        field
 17
        message
 18
      }
 19
    }
 20 }
 Query variables
 1 {
 2
    "checkoutProfileId": "gid://shopify/CheckoutProfile/{profile_ID}",
 3
    "checkoutBrandingInput": {
 4
      "customizations": {
 5
        "favicon": {
 6
          "mediaImageId": "gid://shopify/MediaImage/34829967327254"
 7
 3
      "checkoutBrandingUpsert": {
 4
        "checkoutBranding": {
 5
          "customizations": {
 6
            "favicon": {
 7
              "image": {
 8
                "id": "gid://shopify/ImageSource/34839857299478"
 9
              }
 10
            }
 11
          }
 12
        },
 13
        "userErrors": []
 14
      }
 15
    },
 16 }
 Step 5: View the favicon in checkout
 You can view the favicon in its draft and published state. You might need to refresh the page to see changes.
 In the Shopify admin, click Settings.
 Click Checkout.
 In the Checkout page, click ....
 Select one of the following:

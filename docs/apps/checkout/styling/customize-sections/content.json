 Customize sections
 Sections logically organize groups of content at checkout. Section styling highlights or contours the look of a page, creating high visual impact and expressiveness in structured content.
 With section styles, you can define and add visual emphasis to sections by defining elements like color schemes, padding, border styles, and more. Well-styled sections make it unequivocally clear to customers where they are in the checkout process and where they can find essential information.
 This guide explains how to style common checkout sections, including the header, footer, main section, and order summary. You'll learn some sample customizations, but you can use what you've learned to make other sections customizations.
 Note
 Borders around the sections in the following example represent the one-page checkout experience. In three-page checkout, each step has a single section, with the exception of express checkout options such as Shop Pay, Google Pay, and Apple Pay.
 Tip
 You can reset styles to their defaults by writing parent fields to null with the GraphQL Admin API. Refer to examples of resetting some and all values to the defaults.
 What you'll learn
 In this tutorial, you'll learn how to do the following tasks:
 Retrieve the store's checkout profile ID
 Style checkout's main sections
 Define a custom color scheme, and apply this scheme to checkout sections
 Style the order summary section
 Requirements
 The store that you're modifying must be on a Shopify Plus plan.
 You've created a new development store with the Checkout and Customer Accounts Extensibility developer preview enabled.
 You've completed the GraphQL and REST Admin API getting started guide.
 You've either installed the GraphiQL app on your store or created an app, with the read_checkout_branding_settings and write_checkout_branding_settings access scopes.
 You're using API version 2024-04 or higher.
 You're familiar with the GraphQL Admin API's branding types.
 Step 1: Retrieve the store's checkout profile IDs
 Checkout styling properties apply to a checkout profile ID. In this step, you'll retrieve the checkout profile to which you'll apply sections changes.
 Query checkoutProfiles to retrieve a list of checkout profile IDs.
 The is_published parameter indicates which checkout profile is currently applied to your store's live checkout.
 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json
 GraphQL query
 1 query checkoutProfiles {
 2
    checkoutProfiles(first: 1, query: "is_published:true") {
 3
      edges {
 4
        node {
 5
          id
 6
          name
 7
 3
      "checkoutProfiles": {
 4
        "edges": [
 5
          {
 6
            "node": {
 7
              "id": "gid://shopify/CheckoutProfile/1",
 8
              "name": "Default checkout profile"
 9
            }
 10
 13
    }
 14 }
 Make note of your corresponding ID from the list. You'll supply the ID in subsequent mutations.
 Step 2: Style checkout's main sections
 In this step, you'll apply one of the default color schemes to checkout's main sections. You'll also set the corner radius so that the sections have square corners, and add some padding and a border around them. For all of these customizations, you'll use the checkoutBrandingUpsert mutation's customizations object and the CheckoutBrandingInput input object.
 Tip
 Altering this section helps to distinguish it from other sections, so that customers can consume related information in smaller, more manageable segments.
 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json
 GraphQL mutation
 1 mutation checkoutBrandingUpsert($checkoutBrandingInput: CheckoutBrandingInput!, $checkoutProfileId: ID!) {
 2
    checkoutBrandingUpsert(checkoutBrandingInput: $checkoutBrandingInput, checkoutProfileId: $checkoutProfileId) {
 3
      checkoutBranding {
 4
        customizations {
 5
          main {

            section {

 15
        },
 16
        "userErrors": []
 17
      }
 18
    }
 19 }
 Step 3: Style sections with a custom color scheme
 In this step, you'll define a third color scheme that you'll apply to some more checkout sections.
 Because you're defining a color scheme, you'll use the checkoutBrandingUpsert mutation's designSystem object and the CheckoutBrandingInput input object. When you apply that color scheme to sections, you'll do so with the customizations object.
 Tip
 Consistent styling across these sections amplifies the merchant's brand presence.
 Define the color scheme:

 Deep linking to a cart or checkout using permalinks
 Cart permalinks take customers directly to a store cart or checkout with a pre-loaded cart. When you generate a cart permalink, you direct customers who want to buy a specific product from the sales channel directly to a merchant's store cart or checkout to complete the purchase. Cart permalinks work best for apps that enable customers to buy items from a single merchant.
 Note

 You can use permalinks to do the following:
 Apply one or more variant IDs to a cart or checkout

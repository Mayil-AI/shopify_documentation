 Create cart permalinks
 You can create cart permalinks to direct customers to Shopify checkouts or the online store cart, with pre-loaded items. You can append query parameters to the cart permalink URL to include additional information and attribute an order to your sales channel.
 What you'll learn
 In this tutorial, you'll learn how to do the following tasks:
 Create cart permalinks
 Modify the checkout
 Attribute an order to your sales channel
 Apply discounts
 Add conversion tracking information
 Redirect customers to the Online Store cart instead of checkout
 Scenario
 You have a sales channel app from which you want to link directly to a merchant's checkout or their online store cart. You want your link to pre-load the cart with two specific products.
 Step 1: Create a cart permalink
 Add product variant IDs and quantities to the shop URL.
 http://{shop}.myshopify.com/cart/#{variant_id}:#{quantity}(,...)
 The following example adds one each of two products to the cart by specifying the product variant IDs (70881412 and 70881382) with a quantity of one (1):
 http://{shop}.myshopify.com/cart/70881412:1,70881382:1
 Step 2 (Optional): Modify the checkout
 You can append checkout query parameters to the cart permalink URL.
 The following example includes [email] and [shipping_address] as the checkout fields. [shipping_address][city] shows how you can use nesting to populate child fields.
 http://{shop}.myshopify.com/cart/70881412:1,70881382:1?checkout[email]=example@example.com&checkout[shipping_address][city]=thisismyhometown
 Supported checkout parameters
 Checkout parameter Description
 checkout[email] The email of the customer making the checkout
 checkout[shipping_address][first_name] The first name field for the shipping address
 checkout[shipping_address][last_name] The last name field for the shipping address
 checkout[shipping_address][address1] The address 1 field for the shipping address
 checkout[shipping_address][address2] The address 2 field for the shipping address
 checkout[shipping_address][city] The city field for the shipping address
 checkout[shipping_address][province] The province field for the shipping address
 checkout[shipping_address][country] The country field for the shipping address
 checkout[shipping_address][zip] The postal code field for the shipping address
 Step 3 (Optional): Attribute an order to a sales channel
 To attribute an order to a sales channel, you can add a storefront access token as an additional parameter to the permalink. Merchants can view sales attributions in the Sales by Channel report, which shows the name of the channel that the customer used to place the order. Sales attributions also appear on the sidebar in the Shopify admin.
 You can specify a storefront access token in the cart permalink as shown in the following example:
 http://{shop}.myshopify.com/cart/70881412:1,70881382:1?access_token=#{access_token}
 Step 4 (Optional): Apply discounts
 You can append a discount query parameter to apply discounts in the cart permalink URL, as shown in the following example:
 http://{shop}.myshopify.com/cart/70881412:1,70881382:1?discount={discount_code}
 You can also append multiple discounts in the cart permalink URL, separated by a comma ,:
 http://{shop}.myshopify.com/cart/70881412:1,70881382:1?discount={discount_code},{discount_code2}
 Note
 You can't pass discount codes that contain a comma, such as savings, today!, using the discount URL parameter.
 Step 5 (Optional): Add conversion tracking information
 If you want to add conversion tracking information, then you can append one of the following query parameters to the cart permalink:
 note
 attributes
 ref
 You can add multiple attributes parameters. note and attributes parameters will display in the Notes section on the order details page. The ref parameter will display as a referral code in the Conversion summary section on the details page.
 http://{shop}.myshopify.com/cart/70881412:1,70881382:1?note=came-from-newsletter-2022-01-01
 http://{shop}.myshopify.com/cart/70881412:1,70881382:1?attributes[from]=came-from-newsletter-2022-01-01&attributes[example]=example-value
 http://{shop}.myshopify.com/cart/70881412:1,70881382:1?ref=came-from-newsletter-2022-01-01
 Step 6 (Optional): Redirect to the Online Store cart instead of checkout
 If you want the cart permalink to redirect customers to the Online Store cart instead of the checkout page, then you can append the storefront query parameter in the cart permalink URL:
 http://{shop}.myshopify.com/cart/70881412:1,70881382:1?storefront=true

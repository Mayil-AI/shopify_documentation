Add configuration to your delivery customization
 You can use metafields for the configuration of your delivery customization function. Metafields provide greater flexibility to use functions, and are a prerequisite to creating a merchant user interface for configuring functions.
 What you'll learn
 In this tutorial, you'll learn how to do the following tasks:
 Define what configuration settings will be surfaced to merchants.
 Read and use the merchant-defined values in your function.
 Caution
 In this tutorial, you'll use a metafield namespace that's accessible to any app so that the metafield namespace can be populated using the GraphiQL app. To make your function ready for production, you should update the metafield namespace to use a reserved prefix so that other apps can't use your metafield. You'll make this update in the next tutorial.
 Requirements
 You've completed the Getting started with building delivery customizations tutorial.
 Step 1: Configure the function
 To make your function reusable, you can replace hardcoded values in your function with metafield values. You can update your input query to request a metafield value on the created delivery customization, which is the function owner for this function API. You can then use that value in your function logic.
 Navigate to your function in extensions/delivery-customization.
 Terminal
 $ cd extensions/delivery-customization
 Replace the code in the src/run.graphql file with the following code.
 This update to the input query adds a metafield from the deliveryCustomization object, which is the function owner.
 The query differs slightly in JavaScript and Rust due to code generation requirements.
 run.graphql
 JavaScript input query
 3
      deliveryGroups {
 4
        deliveryAddress {
 5
          provinceCode
 6
        }
 7
        deliveryOptions {
 8
          handle
 9
          title
 10
 13
    deliveryCustomization {
 14
      metafield(namespace: "delivery-customization", key: "function-configuration") {
 15
        value
 16
      }
 17
    }
 18 }
 If you're using JavaScript, then run the following command to regenerate types based on your input query:
 Terminal
 npm
 Yarn
 pnpm
 $ npm run shopify app function typegen
 Replace the src/run.js or src/run.rs file with the following code.
 This update includes parsing the JSON metafield value, and using values from that JSON in the function logic instead of hardcoded values.
 This change is automatically reflected as long as you're running dev.

    operations: [],

 19 export function run(input) {
 20
    // Define a type for your configuration, and parse it from the metafield
 21
    /**
 22
    * @type {{
 23
    *  stateProvinceCode: string
 24
    *  message: number
 25
    * }}
 26
    */
 27
    const configuration = JSON.parse(
 28
      input?.deliveryCustomization?.metafield?.value ?? "{}"
 29
    );
 30
    if (!configuration.stateProvinceCode || !configuration.message) {
 31
      return NO_CHANGES;
 32
    }
 33
 34
    let toRename = input.cart.deliveryGroups
 35
      .filter(group => group.deliveryAddress?.provinceCode &&
 36
        // Use the configured province code instead of a hardcoded value
 37
        group.deliveryAddress.provinceCode == configuration.stateProvinceCode)
 38
      .flatMap(group => group.deliveryOptions)
 39
      .map(option => /** @type {Operation} */({
 40
        rename: {
 41
          deliveryOptionHandle: option.handle,
 42
          // Use the configured message instead of a hardcoded value
 43
          title: option.title ? `${option.title} - ${configuration.message}` : configuration.message
 44
        }
 45
      }));
 46
 47
    return {
 48
      operations: toRename
 49
    };
 50 };
 Step 2: Populate the delivery customization configuration metafield
 To populate the configuration metafield, you'll first use the deliveryCustomizations query to confirm the delivery customization ID, and then use the metafieldsSet mutation to populate the same metafield that you specified in the input query.
 Open the Shopify GraphiQL app on your development store.
 In the GraphiQL app, in the API Version field, select the 2023-07 version.
 Execute the following query, and make note of the id value of the delivery customization that you created in the previous tutorial. For more information about global IDs, refer to Global IDs in Shopify APIs.
 delivery-customization-query.graphql
 1 query {
 2
    deliveryCustomizations(first: 100) {
 3
      edges {
 4
        node {
 5
          id
 6
        }
 Execute the following mutation and replace YOUR_CUSTOMIZATION_ID_HERE with the full global ID of your delivery customization.
 The value of the metafield specifies that the function should add a message for the NC state/province code. You can adjust this to the state/province of your choice.
 metafield-set-mutation.graphql
 1 mutation {
 2
    metafieldsSet(metafields: [
 3
      {
 4
        ownerId: "YOUR_CUSTOMIZATION_ID_HERE"
 5
        namespace: "delivery-customization"
 6
        key: "function-configuration"
 7
        value: "{ \"stateProvinceCode\": \"NC\", \"message\": \"May be delayed due to UFO attack\" }"
 8
        type: "json"
 9
      }
 10
    ]) {
 11
      metafields {
 12
        id
 13
      }
 14
      userErrors {
 15
        message
 16
      }
 17
    }
 18 }
 You should receive a GraphQL response that includes the ID of the created metafield. If the response includes any messages under userErrors, then review the errors, check that your mutation and ownerId are correct, and try the request again.
 Step 3: Test the delivery customization
 Open your development store, build a cart, and proceed to checkout.
 Enter a delivery address that doesn't use the specified state/province code. You shouldn't see any additional messaging on the delivery options.
 Change your shipping address to use your chosen state/province code. Your delivery options should now have the additional messaging.
 To debug your function, or view its output, you can review its logs in your Partner Dashboard.
 Log in to your Partner Dashboard and navigate to Apps > {your app} > Extensions > delivery-customization.
 Click on any function run to view its input, output, and any logs written to STDERR.

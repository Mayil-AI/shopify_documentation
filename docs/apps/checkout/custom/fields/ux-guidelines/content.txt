 UX guidelines for custom fields
 Shopify Plus
 Checkout UI extensions that render on the information and shipping and payment steps in checkout are available only to stores on a Shopify Plus plan.
 This guide introduces UX guidelines for adding custom fields to checkout.
 Placement
 A static target lets you define the placement for the extension. Depending on your use case, you might also define multiple static targets to place your extension. For example, you might want to give the option to place the delivery instructions extension either before or after the shipping methods section.
 src/Checkout.jsx
 src/Checkout.js
 1 ...
 2 // Set multiple entry points for the extension.
 3 // Add all targets to your configuration file.
 4 const shippingRenderBefore = reactExtension("purchase.checkout.shipping-option-list.render-before", () => <App />);
 5 export shippingRenderBefore;
 6
 7 const shippingRenderAfter= reactExtension("purchase.checkout.shipping-option-list.render-after", () => <App />);
 8 export shippingRenderAfter;
 9
 10 function App() {
 11
    ...
 12 }
 Place the delivery instructions extension in close proximity to the checkout step that it's related to. In this case, the static targets purchase.checkout.shipping-option-list.render-before or purchase.checkout.shipping-option-list.render-after are the best locations for this extension type because it concerns delivery instructions.
 Note
 In some cases, extensions might not render if the static target being used is tied to an area that isnâ€™t rendered for the customer. For example, extensions using purchase.checkout.shipping-option-list.render-after won't show in a checkout with only digital products, since they will not be shipped.
 Components
 The components to create a custom field to capture delivery instructions depend on the extension's possible states.
 The delivery instructions use case can have the following states:
 Checkbox is unchecked
 Checkbox checked, TextField then becomes visible
 TextField with value

 Checkbox N/A
 TextField Only show this component when the customer has expressed interest in adding delivery instructions.
 Layout
 You can stack the Checkbox and TextField components in the BlockStack component.

 In the following example, base is the spacing value between the Checkbox and TextField components, which is typically the default option. It prevents the extension from being too cramped or too spacious.
 UX guidelines
 Adhere to the following guidelines when you're designing a delivery instructions use case for checkout UI extensions, so that you can help merchants gain customer trust and provide a great checkout experience:
 Reveal information progressively and strategically
 Show a simplified state of the extension by default. In the following example, the customer can choose to add delivery instructions to an order. If the customer chooses to add delivery instructions, then the TextField is displayed. It doesn't display otherwise.
 Capture and remember customer inputs
 Preserve inputs through the experience. For example, if the customer writes their delivery instructions in the TextField component, then unchecks the Checkbox component and checks it again, the instructions should still display rather than having the customer type them again.

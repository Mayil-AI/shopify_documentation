 Build location rules

 Beta
 Location rules is a new feature that's only available by request. To develop location rules, you need to contact order-routing-early-access@shopify.com.
 What you'll learn
 In this tutorial series, youâ€™ll learn how to do the following tasks:
 Set up your environment to use functions.
 Create a location rule function.
 Add configuration options to your location rule function using metafields.
 Build a location rule user interface using Admin UI extensions.

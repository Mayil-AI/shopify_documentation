 Token exchange
 OAuth 2.0 token exchange (RFC 8693) allows apps to exchange a session token for an access token. The session token is only available for embedded apps and can be acquired using App Bridge.

 Request flow using token exchange API
 The following diagram illustrates the token exchange flow from the point a merchant interacts with the app to the point the app receives an access token and can make authenticated API requests.
 Getting started
 You can use Shopify CLI to generate a starter app with boilerplate code that handles authorization using session tokens and token exchange. This is the recommended method.
 You can also implement token exchange manually.

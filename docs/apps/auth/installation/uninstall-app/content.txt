 Uninstall a Shopify app with an API call
 You might be required to remove old app installations from a system. If user intervention isn't required to remove the app, then you can send a request to the Shopify API to remove an app from a store.
 This guide is for developers who want to uninstall their app from a store through the API. If you're an app user trying to uninstall an app from your store, refer to the merchant help documentation instead.
 How it works
 Uninstalling an app triggers cleanup tasks in Shopify. This includes deleting any registered webhooks, script tags, and Shopify admin links. If an app is uninstalled during key rotation, then both the old and new access tokens will become unusable.
 Caution
 Uninstalling an app is an irreversible operation. Before you uninstall an app, make sure that you no longer need to make API calls for the store in which the app has been installed.
 Examples
 The following examples show how to uninstall a Shopify app from a store using an API call:
 Ruby
 PHP
 1 require 'rest_client'
 2 require 'json'
 3
 4 access_token = 'secret'
 5 revoke_url   = 'https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api_permissions/current.json'
 6
 7 headers = {
 8
    'X-Shopify-Access-Token' => access_token,
 9
    content_type: 'application/json',
 10
    accept: 'application/json'
 11 }
 12
 13 response = RestClient.delete(revoke_url, headers)
 14 response.code # 200 for success

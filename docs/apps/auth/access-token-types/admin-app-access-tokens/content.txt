 Access tokens for custom apps in the Shopify admin
 You can create a custom app for a store directly in the Shopify admin. To authenticate an admin-created custom app, you or the app user needs to install the app from the Shopify admin to generate API credentials and the necessary API access tokens.
 Note
 This guide applies only to custom apps that were created in the Shopify admin. If you created a custom storefront with the Headless channel in the Shopify admin, then Shopify creates public and private access tokens for you. For more information, refer to Getting started with the Storefront API. If you created a custom app in the Partner Dashboard or with Shopify CLI, then you should use token exchange if your app is embedded and authorization code grant if it is not.
 Requirements
 You or the app user you're working with has created a Shopify store.
 If you have a staff or collaborator account on a user's store, then make sure that the user gives you the relevant permissions to create a custom app and assign API scopes.
 You understand how apps fit into Shopify and the different ways that you can distribute your app.
 You're familiar with the different methods of authenticating and authorizing apps with Shopify’s platform.
 Step 1: Create and install the app
 You or the user can create and install a custom app in the Shopify admin by following the Custom apps documentation on the Shopify Help Center.
 Step 2: Make authenticated requests
 A custom app can make authenticated requests to the REST Admin API or the GraphQL Admin API using the API access tokens that are generated when the app is installed on the store.
 The following examples show how to retrieve a list of products using the GraphQL Admin API and the REST Admin API.
 Terminal

 REST
 1 curl -X POST \

    https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/2024-04/graphql.json \

    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 4
    -H 'X-Shopify-Access-Token: {access_token}' \
 5
    -d '{

      "query": "query {
 7
        products(first: 5) {
 8
          edges {
 9
            node {
 10
              id
 11
              handle
 12
            }
 13
          }
 14
          pageInfo {
 15
            hasNextPage
 16
          }
 17
        }
 18
      }"
 19
    }'
 Rotating API credentials for admin-created apps
 To rotate the API credentials for a custom app that was created in the Shopify admin, you need to uninstall and reinstall the app. To uninstall and reinstall your app, refer to the Custom apps documentation on the Shopify Help Center.
 Caution
 Because you need to uninstall and reinstall the app to rotate the API credentials, requests and webhooks for your app will be interrupted until you put the new credentials into your app's code.
 If you want to rotate access tokens for a custom storefront that you build with the Headless channel, refer to the documentation on rotating private access tokens in the Shopify admin.
 Changing API scopes
 Anyone with a staff or collaborator account on a store can change what store resources an admin-created custom app can access, but only if they have all the following permissions:
 the Manage and install apps and channels permission and the Develop apps permission
 the relevant permissions for the respective store resource
 For example, if a staff or collaborator account has the View or manage products, variants, and collections permission for the store, then they can only change API scopes related to the store's products, variants, and collections.
 The store owner can change the permissions for a staff or collaborator account in the Shopify admin.
 Permissions required to assign scopes to a custom app
 The following table shows what store permissions a staff account or collaborator account needs to assign Admin API access scopes to an admin-created custom app. In all cases, the account must also have the Develop apps permission.

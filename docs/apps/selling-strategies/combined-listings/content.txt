 Combined listings
 Shopify Plus
 Combined listings are available only to stores on a Shopify Plus plan.
 Combined listings bring together products that are merchandised by an option, such as color, model, or dimension, for enhanced display in the product details page.
 Early Access
 The GraphQL Admin API has been updated to support the creation of combined listings. To be considered for early access to these API updates, please reach out to Partner support.
 How it works
 Combined listings use Shopify's existing product model to create combinations of multiple child products under a single parent product. When a customer views the parent or child products in your online store, they will see a single product with all of the options available to them across all of the child products.
 For example, if you have a shoe that comes in three colors and ten sizes, and you have each of the colors as a separate product, then you can create a combined listing that displays all three products on the same product page along with the ten sizes for each.
 Child products
 Child products represent each of the option values that you want to merchandise. They each have their own images and URL handles and can be merchandised separately. The child products that you want to display together should already be created in your store before you create the combined listing through the app. You can create and add more child products to the combined listing later as well.
 Parent products
 Parent products are created when you create a combined listing. They too are just products, but when the combined listing is created, they're associated with the child products.
 By using a parent product, you gain the additional options provided by the parent, resulting in a total of six options.
 Note
 Unlike child products, parent products can't be purchased, don't have their own inventory, and don't have any sales data associated with them.
 Lifecycle of a combined listing
 From creation to purchase, combined listings have a modified lifecycle that involves the Shopify admin, the Combined Listings app, and your Online Store theme.

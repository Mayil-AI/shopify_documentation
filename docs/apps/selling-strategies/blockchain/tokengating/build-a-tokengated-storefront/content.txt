 Build a tokengated storefront
 You can use tokengating to create exclusive access and unlockable discounts for your customer segments. Whether you want to reward your most loyal customers or another brand's token holders, this tutorial shows you how to create end-to-end tokengating experiences with Headless and Hydrogen storefronts.
 What you'll learn
 In this tutorial series, you'll learn how to use the Gates API to read gates on products, use a connected crypto wallet to check wallet contents against gates, and react accordingly. The end result is an end-to-end gated customer experience that applies discounts to the cart automatically using Shopify Functions.
 Before you start this tutorial, you first need to create gates using the Gates API, and build Shopify Function that applies a gated discount. Refer to the following tutorials for more information:

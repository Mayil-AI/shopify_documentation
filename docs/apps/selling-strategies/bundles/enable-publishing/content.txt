 Bundle products are published in the same way as any other product. After you enable the feature, merchants that use your app can publish bundles products with the following steps:
 From your Shopify admin, go to Products.
 Click the product's name to open its details. The product is included in the sales channels listed in the Publishing section.
 Click â‹® > Manage sales channels.
 Select the sales channels and apps that you want to include the product in.
 Click Done.
 Click Save.
 After publishing bundles on the custom storefront, they will be available for buyers to purchase.

 Manage delivery profiles
 You can use delivery profiles to manage advanced shipping information in Shopify. Shops that use delivery profiles gain the ability to create shipping rates per product variant and location.
 This guide shows you how to manage delivery profiles for deferred purchase options.
 Requirements
 Your app can make authenticated requests to the GraphQL Admin API.
 Your app has the following access scopes:
 write_products
 read_all_orders
 read_customer_payment_methods
 read_purchase_options
 write_purchase_options
 read_payment_mandate
 write_payment_mandate
 Learn how to configure your access scopes using Shopify CLI.
 You've completed the Create and manage deferred purchase options guide.
 Note
 Most Subscriptions, Pre-order and Try before you buy (TBYB) apps need to request API access through the Partner Dashboard. We give API access to apps that are designed according to our principles for Subscriptions, Pre-order and TBYB apps.
 Public apps that use Subscriptions, Pre-order or TBYB need to meet specific requirements to be published on the Shopify App Store.
 Custom apps created in the Shopify admin can't use Subscriptions, Pre-order or TBYB because these apps can't use extensions or request access to protected scopes. If you're building a solution for a single store, then build your custom app in the Partner Dashboard.
 Step 1: Create delivery profiles
 A delivery profile is a set of shipping rates scoped to a set of products or variants that can be shipped from selected locations to zones. You can associate the DeliveryProfile with the SellingPlanGroup object to do the following tasks:
 Set free shipping for all orders with deferred purchase options
 Restrict shipping to specific countries
 Set a flat shipping rate by country for all orders with deferred purchase options
 Set free shipping
 You can set free shipping for all orders with a deferred purchase option. The following example uses the deliveryProfileCreate mutation to set free shipping.

 Set a flat shipping rate by country
 You can set a flat shipping rate by delivery zone for all orders with deferred purchase options. The following example defines free shipping to Canada and defines a $15.00 flat shipping rate for the rest of the world:

 73
          ]
 74
        }
 75
      }
 76
    }
 77 }
 Step 2: Retrieve delivery profiles
 You can use the deliveryProfiles query to retrieve a list of delivery profiles.
 The following query returns a delivery profile with its ID, name, and default setting. Product variants stay in the default profile until they are added to another delivery profile. The example response indicates that the default profile is returned.
 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json
 GraphQL query
 1 query {
 2
    deliveryProfiles (first: 1) {
 3
      edges {
 4
        node {
 5
          id
 6
          name
 7
          default
 8
        }
 9
      }
 2
    "data": {
 3
      "deliveryProfiles": {
 4
 7
              "id": "gid://shopify/DeliveryProfile/4227128",
 8
              "name": "Default",
 9
              "default": true
 10
            }
 11
          }
 12
        ]
 13
      }
 14
    },
 15
    ...
 16 }
 Step 3: Update delivery profiles
 You can use the deliveryProfileUpdate mutation to update existing delivery profiles. The following example adds the United States delivery zone:
 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json
 GraphQL mutation
 1 mutation {
 2
    deliveryProfileUpdate(
 3
      # Specify the delivery profile ID to update.
 4
      id: "gid://shopify/DeliveryProfile/3"
 5
      profile: {
 6
        locationGroupsToCreate: {
 7
          locations: "gid://shopify/Location/1"
 8
          # Create a new delivery zone.
 9
          zonesToCreate: [
 10
            {
 11
              name: "United States"
 12
              countries: { code: US, includeAllProvinces: true }
 13
              methodDefinitionsToCreate: {
 14
                # Set the rate definition for the delivery zone.
 15
                rateDefinition: { price: { amount: 0, currencyCode: CAD } }
 16
                name: "Free Shipping"
 17
              }
 18
            }
 19
          ]
 20
        }
 21
      }
 22
    ) {
 23
      profile {
 24
        id
 25
        profileLocationGroups {
 26
          locationGroupZones(first: 5) {
 27
            edges {
 28
              node {
 29
                zone {
 30
                  id
 31
                  name
 32
                  countries {
 33
                    id
 34
                    name
 35
                    provinces {
 36
                      id
 37
                      name
 38
                      code
 39
                    }
 40
                  }
 41
                }
 42
              }

 Step 4 (Optional): Remove a delivery profile
 You can asynchronously remove a delivery profile by using the deliveryProfileRemove mutation, and passing in the ID of the delivery profile that you want to remove. The response returns a job ID that you can use to check on the job status and determine whether the operation is complete:
 If done is true, then the removal of the delivery profile has completed.
 If done is false, then removal of the delivery profile is still in progress.
 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json
 GraphQL mutation
 1 mutation removeDeliveryProfile {
 2
    deliveryProfileRemove(

          id: "gid://shopify/DeliveryProfile/46528069654")

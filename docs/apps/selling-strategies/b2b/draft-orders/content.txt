 Manage draft orders
 Shopify Plus
 Only stores on the Shopify Plus plan can use apps with B2B features.
 Merchants often need to create draft orders for company approval when selling business-to-business (B2B). After creating a company, you can use the GraphQL Admin API to create draft orders for a purchasing entity. A purchasing entity is a combination of the company, company contact, and company location.

 Step 1: Calculate a draft order for a purchasing entity
 Before creating a draft order for a purchasing entity, you can preview information such as total taxes and prices using the draftOrderCalculate mutation:
 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json
 GraphQL mutation
 1 mutation{
 2
    draftOrderCalculate(
 3
      input: {
 4
        purchasingEntity: {
 5
           purchasingCompany: {
 6
             companyId: "gid://shopify/Company/1"
 7
             companyLocationId: "gid://shopify/CompanyLocation/1"
 8
             companyContactId: "gid://shopify/CompanyContact/1"

           }

 JSON response

        "totalPrice": 132.99
 Step 2: Create a draft order for a purchasing entity
 When you're satisfied with the calculated draft order, you can create the draft order by passing the same input from your calculated draft order to the draftOrderCreate mutation:
 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json
 GraphQL mutation
 1 mutation{
 2
    draftOrderCreate(
 3
      input: {
 4
        purchasingEntity: {
 5
           purchasingCompany: {
 6
             companyId: "gid://shopify/Company/1"
 7
             companyLocationId: "gid://shopify/CompanyLocation/1"
 8
             companyContactId: "gid://shopify/CompanyContact/1"
 9
           }
 10
        }
 11
        billingAddress: {
 12
          address1: "273 Lenore Stravenue",
 13
          address2: "Suite 573",
 14
          city: "Laketown",
 15
          company: "Alfredo Group",
 16
          firstName: "Avery",
 17
          lastName: "Brown",
 18
          phone: "(800) 555 0100",
 19
          provinceCode: "TN",
 20
          zip: "38103"
 21
        },
 22
        customAttributes: null,
 23
        lineItems: [
 24
          {
 25
            appliedDiscount: null,
 26
            originalUnitPrice: "132.99",
 27
            quantity: 1,
 28
            sku: "",

            title: "Aerodynamic Bronze Car",

            variantId: "gid://shopify/ProductVariant/349",

            taxable: true,
 32
            requiresShipping: true,
 33
            customAttributes: [],
 34
          }
 35
        ],
 36
        note: null,
 37
        shippingAddress: {
 38
          address1: "273 Lenore Stravenue",

          address2: "Suite 573",

 44
          phone: "(800) 555 0100",
 45
          provinceCode: "TN",
 46
          zip: "38103"
 47
        },
 48
        tags: [],
 49
        email: "averybrown@example.com",
 50
        phone: null,
 51
        taxExempt: false,
 52
        reserveInventoryUntil: null,
 53
        appliedDiscount: null,
 54
        shippingLine: null,
 55
        localizationExtensions: []
 56
      }
 57
    ) {
 58
      draftOrder{
 59
        id
 60
        totalPrice
 61
      }
 62
    }
 63 }
 JSON response
 1 {
 2
    "data": {
 3
      "draftOrder": {
 4
        "id": "gid://shopify/DraftOrder/10"
 5
        "totalPrice": 132.99
 6
      }
 7
    }
 8 }
 Step 3: Send an invoice for a draft order
 Sending an invoice for a B2B draft order is identical to sending an invoice for a consumer draft order. After creating a draft order, you can pass the draft order ID to the draftOrderInvoiceSend mutation to send the invoice to the company contact:
 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json
 GraphQL mutation
 1 mutation{
 2
    draftOrderInvoiceSend(
 3
      id: "gid://shopify/DraftOrder/10"
 4
    ) {
 5
      draftOrder{
 6
        id
 7
      }
 2
    "data": {
 3
      "draftOrder": {
 4
        "id": "gid://shopify/DraftOrder/10"
 5
      }
 6
    }
 7 }
 Step 4: Mark a draft order as complete
 Marking a B2B draft order as complete is identical to marking a consumer draft order as complete. After creating a draft order, you can pass the draft order ID to the draftOrderComplete mutation to mark the draft order as complete and create a corresponding order:
 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json
 GraphQL mutation
 1 mutation{
 2
    draftOrderComplete(
 3
      id: "gid://shopify/DraftOrder/10"
 4
    ) {
 5
      draftOrder{
 6
        id
 7
        order {
 8
          id
 9
        }
 10
      }
 11
    }
 12 }
 JSON response
 1 {
 2
    "data": {
 3
      "draftOrder": {
 4
        "id": "gid://shopify/DraftOrder/10",
 5
        "order": {
 6
          "id": "gid://shopify/Order/1"
 7
 10 }

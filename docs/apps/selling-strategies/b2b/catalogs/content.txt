 Manage B2B catalogs
 Caution
 Starting in API version 2023-04, the PriceList.contextRule field will be deprecated. If you have an existing app that uses the contextRule field, then you should migrate to catalogs.
 Catalogs are used to determine the products that are published to customers in different contexts. For example, a business-to-business (B2B) catalog might specify that customers ordering for a specific B2B company location can purchase only the t-shirt products in the store at a 30% discount.
 In this guide, you'll learn how to build price lists and publications, and associate them with catalogs to control prices and publishing for a specific B2B company location.
 Requirements
 Your app can make authenticated requests to the GraphQL Admin API.
 Your app has the write_products access scope. Learn how to configure your access scopes using Shopify CLI.
 You've created products and product variants in your store.
 You're familiar with the concept of catalogs.
 You've created a company and created a B2B catalog.
 Step 1: Associate a price list with the catalog
 You can associate a price list with the catalog to determine the prices that are shown to customers ordering for that B2B company location. If a price list isn't associated with the catalog, then customers ordering for this B2B company location receive the initial variant prices converted to the market currency.
 Create a new price list
 Use the priceListCreate mutation to create a new price list for the catalog. You can set the name, a percentage-based adjustment, a currency, and the ID of the catalog to associate.
 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json
 GraphQL mutation
 1 mutation priceListCreate($input: PriceListCreateInput!) {
 2
    priceListCreate(input: $input) {
 3
      priceList {
 4
        id
 5
      }
 6
      userErrors {

      "name": "Prices for Company's Canadian location",
 4
      "currency": "CAD",

        },

        "priceList": {

          "id": "gid://shopify/PriceList/ID"
 6
        },
 7
        "userErrors": []
 8
      }
 9
    }
 10 }
 Associate an existing price list
 Use the priceListUpdate mutation to associate an existing price list with a catalog. You can also make changes to the name, currency, or percentage-based adjustments with the priceListUpdate mutation.
 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json
 GraphQL mutation
 1 mutation priceListUpdate($id: ID!, $input: PriceListUpdateInput!) {
 2
    priceListUpdate(id: $id, input: $input) {
 3
      priceList {
 4
        id
 10
    }
 11 }
 Variables
 1 {
 2
    "id": "gid://shopify/PriceList/ID",
 3
    "input": {
 4
      "catalogId": "gid://shopify/CompanyLocationCatalog/CATALOG-ID"
 5
    }

 JSON response
 1 {
 2
    "data": {
 3
      "priceListUpdate": {
 4
        "priceList": {
 5
          "id": "gid://shopify/PriceList/ID"
 6
 9
    }
 10 }
 Step 2: Associate a publication
 Caution
 If a publication isn't associated with a B2B catalog, then customers logged into their B2B accounts won't see any products for that location.
 The publication determines which products are published to customers that are eligible for the catalog.
 If you have an existing publication, then you can use the catalogUpdate mutation to associate a publication or make other changes to a catalog.
 To create and associate a new publication, use the publicationCreate mutation:
 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json
 GraphQL mutation
 1 mutation publicationCreate {
 2
    publicationCreate(input: {
 3
      catalogId: "gid://shopify/CompanyLocationCatalog/CATALOG-ID"
 4
      defaultState: ALL_PRODUCTS
 5
    }) {
 6
      publication {
 7
        id
 8
        catalog { id title }
 9
      }
 10
      userErrors {
 11
        code
 12
        field
 13
        message
 14
      }
 15
    }
 16 }
 JSON response
 1 {
 2
    "data": {
 3
      "publicationCreate": {
 4
        "publication": {
 5
          "id": "gid://shopify/Publication/123",
 6
          "catalog": {
 7
            "id": "gid://shopify/CompanyLocationCatalog/1",
 8
            "title": "Catalog for Company's Canadian location"
 9
          }
 10
        },
 11
        "userErrors": []
 12
      }
 13
    }
 14 }
 Add products and collections to the publication
 After you create a publication, you can add products and collections to the publication with the publicationUpdate mutation:
 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json
 GraphQL mutation
 1 mutation publicationUpdate {
 2
    publicationUpdate(
 3
      id: "gid://shopify/Publication/1",
 4
      input: {
 5
        publishablesToAdd: ["gid://shopify/Product/1"],
 6
        publishablesToRemove: ["gid://shopify/Product/2"]
 7
      }) {
 8
      publication {
 9
        products(first: 10) {
 10
          edges {
 11
            node {
 12
              id
 13
            }
 14
          }
 15
        }
 16
      }
 17
      userErrors {
 18
        field
 19
        code
 20
        message
 21
      }
 22
    }
 23 }
 JSON response
 1 {
 2
    "data": {
 3
      "publicationUpdate": {
 4
        "publication": {
 5
          "products": {
 6
            "edges": [
 7
              {
 8
                "node": {
 9
                  "id": "gid://shopify/Product/1"
 10
                }
 11
              }
 12
            ]
 13
          }
 14
        },
 15
        "userErrors": []
 16
      }
 17
    }
 18 }
 Step 3: Set fixed prices for specific product variants
 Use the priceListFixedPricesAdd mutation to set a fixed price for specific product variants.
 If a product variant is published to the catalog and doesn’t have a set fixed price, then its price is automatically calculated using the percentage-based adjustment that’s specified in the PriceListParent object.
 Caution
 The priceListFixedPricesAdd mutation accepts a maximum of 250 prices for each request and acts as an add and replace operation. If a fixed price for a given variant already exists on the price list, then it’s replaced.
 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json
 GraphQL mutation
 1 mutation priceListFixedPricesAdd(
 2
    $priceListId: ID!,
 3
    $prices: [PriceListPriceInput!]!
 4 ) {
 5
    priceListFixedPricesAdd(priceListId: $priceListId, prices: $prices) {
 6
      prices {
 7
        variant {
 8
          id
 9
        }
 10
      }
 11
      userErrors {
 12
        field
 13
        message
 14
      }
 15
    }
 16 }
 Variables
 1 {
 2
    "priceListId": "gid://shopify/PriceList/ID",
 3
    "prices": [
 4
      {
 5
        "variantId": "gid://shopify/ProductVariant/ID",
 6
        "price": {
 7
          "amount": "10.00",
 8
          "currencyCode": "CAD"
 9
        },
 10
        "compareAtPrice": {
 11
          "amount": "12.00",
 12
          "currencyCode": "CAD"
 13
        }
 14
      },
 15
      {
 16
        "variantId": "gid://shopify/ProductVariant/ID-2",
 17
        "price": {
 18
          "amount": "15.00",
 19
          "currencyCode": "CAD"
 20
        }
 21
      }
 22
    ]
 23 }
 JSON response
 1 {
 2
    "data": {
 3
      "priceListFixedPricesAdd": {
 4
        "prices": [
 5
          {
 6
            "variant": {
 7
              "id": "gid://shopify/ProductVariant/ID"
 8
            }
 9
          },
 10
          {
 11
            "variant": {
 12
              "id": "gid://shopify/ProductVariant/ID"
 13
            }
 14
          }
 15
        ],
 16
        "userErrors": []
 17
      }
 18
    }
 19 }
 Delete fixed prices
 To delete a partial set of fixed prices on a price list, you can use the priceListFixedPricesDelete mutation. After a fixed price is deleted, the price for the affected product variant is automatically calculated using the price list parent's percentage-based adjustment.
 To delete fixed prices, you need to specify the variant ID. You can specify a maximum of 250 variant IDs in the array.
 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json
 GraphQL mutation
 1 mutation priceListFixedPricesDelete(
 2
    $priceListId: ID!,
 3
    $variantIds: [ID!]!
 4 ) {
 5
    priceListFixedPricesDelete(priceListId: $priceListId, variantIds: $variantIds) {
 6
      userErrors {
 7
 10
    }
 11 }
 Variables
 1 {
 2
    "priceListId": "gid://shopify/PriceList/ID",
 3
    "variantIds": [
 4
      "gid://shopify/ProductVariant/ID"
 5
    ]
 6 }
 JSON response
 1 {
 2
    "data": {
 3
      "priceListFixedPricesDelete": {
 4
        "deletedFixedPriceVariantIds": [
 5
          "gid://shopify/ProductVariant/ID"
 6
        ],
 7
        "userErrors": []
 8
      }
 9
    }
 10 }

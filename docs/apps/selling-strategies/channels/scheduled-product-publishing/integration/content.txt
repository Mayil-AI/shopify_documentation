 Integrating with scheduled publishing
 This tutorial explains how to integrate your channel app with scheduled product publishing. The use case is simple, but you'll learn how to find resources to build more complex use cases on your own.
 Outcomes
 After you've finished this tutorial, you'll know how to do the following:
 Request access to scheduled publishing
 Retrieve products that are scheduled to be published to a sales channel
 Poll the GraphQL Admin API to know what products are about to be made available to the channel
 Requirements
 You've completed the Getting started tutorials.
 Access scopes
 Your app requires the read_product_listings access scope.
 Step 1: Request access to scheduled publishing
 From the Partner Dashboard, go to Apps and then select your app from the list.
 From your app's overview screen, click Configuration.
 In the App settings section, on the Product Scheduled Publishing card, click Enable feature.
 Note
 If your channel doesn't include product validation, then you only need to complete this step.
 Step 2 (optional): Identify products that are scheduled for publication
 Request resourcePublicationOnCurrentPublication on the GraphQL Admin API's Product object. A publishDate in the future indicates that the product is scheduled to display on the channel at the specified datetime.
 For example,
 POST /api/{api_version}/graphql.json
 GraphQL query
 JSON response
 1 {
 2
    products(first: 10) {
 3
      edges {
 4
        node {
 5
          title
 6
          resourcePublicationOnCurrentPublication {
 7
            publication {
 8
              name
 9
              id
 10
            }
 11
            publishDate
 12
            isPublished
 13
          }
 14
        }
 15
      }
 16
    }
 17 }
 Step 3: Subscribe to webhooks
 Note
 This step is only required if the channel validates products against requirements before displaying them.
 Shopify's SCHEDULED_PRODUCT_LISTINGS webhooks notify channels when products are scheduled to be published.
 The following is an example payload:

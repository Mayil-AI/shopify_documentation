 Order action menu extensions
 Order action menu extensions render buttons on the Order index and Order status pages that allow customers to take actions on their order.
 How it works
 The order action menu offers a static customer-account.order.action.menu-item.render extension target that renders on both the Order index and Order status pages in customer accounts.
 To complete the order action flow, you can link the button to a modal. For example, to prompt the customer to confirm the action, or surface additional UI needed to complete the order action. The CustomerAccountAction component is a modal that renders the customer-account.order.action.render static extension target.
 If the order action experience youâ€™re building requires complex forms or large amounts of information, you can alternatively also link a button to a full-page extension, or any other function or action.
 Limitations
 The customer-account-order-action-menu-item-render target only supports the Button component, which is available in the checkout UI extension component library.

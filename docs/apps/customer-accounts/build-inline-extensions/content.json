 Inline extensions
 Inline extensions are any static extensions or block extensions that add UI to a customer accounts page, such as Order index, Order status, or Profile.
 How it works
 On each customer account page, there are static and block extension targets available in designated areas. Static extension targets only render in one designated location, while block extensions offer merchants the flexibility to place the extension in a multiple designated locations on the page.
 In the following example, the Order status page contains two extensions. The banner at the top of the page is populating the extension target customer-account.order-status.block.render. Block extensions are flexible and merchants can move them to any of the supported locations on the page. The “Write a review” feature below the order status is populating the extension target customer-account.order-status.fulfillment-details.render-after. Static extensions are fixed, and merchants cannot move them to another location.

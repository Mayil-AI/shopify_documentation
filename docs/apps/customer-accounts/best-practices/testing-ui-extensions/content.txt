 Testing customer account UI extensions
 Follow these guidelines to test your customer account UI extensions in different user scenarios. Recreating merchant and customer experiences helps ensure that extensions behave as desired in different locations.
 Test locally
 The inline and order action menu extensions tutorials show you how to start generating and previewing extensions. Previewing UI extensions locally is different when you use static versus block targets.
 Static targets
 When you're using a static target, the UI extension automatically renders in a chosen location.
 Shopify Plus
 Some static extensions on the Profile page only render for B2B customers. B2B on Shopify is only available on the Shopify Plus plan. Explore B2B Profile targets
 Block targets
 When you're using a block target, merchants can choose where to place the UI extension. To preview a block extension in each supported location, append ?placement-reference={name} to the customer URL that's outputted by Shopify CLI. For example, ?placement-reference=ORDER_SUMMARY3.
 The following are the placement reference names for each page:
 Placement references
 Order index
 PAGE_TITLE
 ORDER_INDEX
 Order status
 PAGE_TITLE
 ORDER_STATUS1, ORDER_STATUS2, and ORDER_STATUS3
 ORDER_SUMMARY1, ORDER_SUMMARY2, and ORDER_SUMMARY3

 How triggers work
 A trigger is a task in Shopify Flow that starts the execution of a workflow. The trigger represents an event that happens in a store or in an app. You can build a trigger for Shopify Flow so that events in your app trigger workflows to run.
 Note
 Triggers that use the "customer" Shopify property are also available to Shopify marketing automations.
 Next steps
 To build a trigger, you need to create a trigger extension in your app. In that extension, you specify details about the trigger using a TOML file.
 Once you have published your extension, you can then test or use it by calling the Shopify API with the trigger payload.

 How actions work
 An action is a workflow component in Shopify Flow. It represents a task that's executed in a store or in an app when certain conditions are met. You can connect your app to Shopify Flow so that your app receives data when a workflow action runs.
 This guide shows you how to add an action to your app so that users can use it in their workflows.

 Content
 Writing and designing content in a thoughtful way makes your app usable, accessible, and readable.
 Voice and tone
 Your written content’s voice and tone help you talk to merchants in a consistent, recognizable way.
 Voice refers to aspects of writing that are consistent across all contexts and audiences. Tone can change based on the audience and their current context.
 Learn how to apply Shopify’s voice and choose the right tone, no matter what app you’re building, by referring to the Polaris guidelines on voice and tone.
 Product content
 The following are some principles behind writing product content for a quality merchant experience.
 Do Not
 Don’t duplicate content, such as adding a page title under the App Bridge-set page title, adding horizontal navigation when using the App Bridge ui-nav-menu web component or NavMenu React component, or presenting the same content in different ways on the same page.
 Use plain language
 Shopify merchants are located all over the world, have varying levels of literacy, and might not speak English as their first language. Content can easily be mistranslated or misinterpreted.
 Structure your content in a clear, efficient way.
 Must Do
 Use headings, bullets, and short sentences to make your content more scannable.
 Must Do
 Use clear terms that are easily understood. As a benchmark, aim for a United States grade 7 reading level. You can check reading levels with tools like Hemingway App.
 Do Not
 Don't use jargon or overly technical language that might be difficult for merchants to understand.
 Do Not
 Don't use large blocks of text, because they're hard for merchants to scan and gather the most important information quickly.
 Do Not
 Don't use idioms and phrases with indirect or ironic meanings, as they can be misinterpreted or mistranslated.
 Be consistent
 To help merchants understand key concepts and actions, use terms in a consistent way.
 One way to ensure consistency is to identify and eliminate synonyms for key concepts and actions.
 Must Do
 Use a single noun, verb, or phrase to describe a specific thing, action, or concept.
 Do Not
 Don’t use multiple synonyms to describe a specific thing, action, or concept.
 Encourage action
 Merchants use Shopify to get things done for their businesses. Write content that helps merchants understand and take the most important actions.
 Must Do
 For calls to action (CTAs), start with a strong verb that describes the action. Use active voice to clarify the subject and the action.
 Must Do
 Prioritize the most important information and tasks. Break complicated tasks into steps that focus on individual actions.
 Guide, don’t prescribe
 Write in a way that puts your merchant at the center and in control. Provide merchants with tools and knowledge for making the best decision.
 Must Do
 Give merchants enough information to make the right decision on their own.
 Grammar and mechanics
 For spelling, punctuation, and other grammatical considerations, refer to the Polaris guidelines on grammar and mechanics.
 Must Do
 In the first reference to your app or company, use its proper name to avoid confusing merchants. If you require additional references in the same content section, then you can use "we". This helps maintain clarity while keeping the content concise.

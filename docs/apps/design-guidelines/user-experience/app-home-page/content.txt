 App home page
 Your app home page is the first page that merchants see, and it should provide daily value to them.
 Design
 Design the app home page in a way that quickly answers any questions that merchants might have and conveys the actions that are available to them.

 Purpose
 App homepages take many forms. A good home page should do the following:
 Provide status updates.
 Enable merchants to respond to immediate needs.
 Provide clear call-to-action (CTA) buttons so that merchants can easily see the actions that they can perform in the app.
 Must Do
 Your app home page should provide merchants with quick statistics, status updates, or information that’s immediately actionable.
 Support
 Providing stellar customer support is a great way to set your app and service apart from the rest. Place your support CTAs in a place that's consistent and discoverable. Be as responsive to merchant questions as you can.
 Place your support CTAs consistently, but also out of the way of merchants. You can use an item in App Bridge’s ui-nav-menu web component or NavMenu React component, place a link in your page footers, or use a floating action button.

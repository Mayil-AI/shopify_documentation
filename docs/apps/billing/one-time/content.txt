 Create one-time app purchases
 A single one-time app charge uses a pricing model similar to purchasing a product, where you make a one-time payment at the time of purchase. Multiple app charges follow a pay-as-you-go pricing model, meaning that when use of a service or product has reached a certain limit, another payment is made to continue using it. In this case, the one time charge represents multiple charges that your app creates.
 Merchants must approve the pricing plan. After accepting the charges, the merchant is redirected to a URL that you provide.
 Requirements
 Your app can make authenticated requests to the GraphQL Admin API.
 Step 1: Create the charge
 Refer to an example of creating a one-time app charge.
 Make a request to the appPurchaseOneTimeCreate mutation with the following information:
 name
 price
 returnUrl
 currencyCode
 Step 2: Monitor updates to one-time app purchases
 To receive notifications when merchants update their one-time app purchases, subscribe to the GraphQL Admin API's APP_PURCHASES_ONE_TIME_UPDATE webhook topic.

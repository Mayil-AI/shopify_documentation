 App Store
 Billing users for your app
 The app billing API resources are mandatory for all listed and unlisted apps that are distributed through the Shopify App Store, unless Shopify has notified you otherwise. Contact us if you have questions or concerns.
 Use the GraphQL Admin API and Partner API's billing resources to process charges using Shopifyâ€™s merchant invoicing system. You can view data on app charges using the Partner Dashboard and the GraphQL Admin API.
 Caution
 API billing resources don't support complex calculations for charges. Instead, the API instructs the billing system to collect specific charges. You determine those charges when you configure your app's pricing model. When you configure the pricing model, you'll need to provide the necessary parameters for the API to collect the desired amount.
 Why use Shopify's app billing resources
 Shopify's app billing resources provide the following benefits:
 Simplified payment process: Charges are directly added to the merchant's Shopify invoice.
 Increased conversion rates: Apps that use the billing API resources experience higher rates of customers transitioning from free to paid versions, because charges originate directly from Shopify.
 Revenue sharing: You automatically receive a share of the revenue that Shopify collects.
 Chargeback handling: Shopify handles all chargeback-related processes.
 Flexible pricing models: You can choose your pricing model and set your own prices. Shopify collects funds and ensures timely payments.
 Pricing models
 The pricing model determines the charges that are collected for your app.
 You can use Shopify's app billing API resources to implement one or more of the following models:

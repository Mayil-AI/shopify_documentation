 Create a time-based subscription
 A time-based subscription is a pricing model that charges a consistent, recurring amount for a service. Shopify offers billing intervals for every 30 days and every 365 days.
 Merchants must approve the pricing plan. After accepting the charges, the merchant is redirected to a URL that you provide.
 Requirements
 Your app can make authenticated requests to the GraphQL Admin API.
 Step 1: Create the subscription
 Refer to an example of creating an app subscription.
 Make a request to the appSubscriptionCreate mutation with the following information:
 name
 returnURL
 Use the appRecurringPricingDetails field on the line item's plan to provide the following information:
 currencyCode
 price
 interval
 Note
 The interval field accepts ANNUAL or EVERY_30_DAYS. If not provided, then the default of EVERY_30_DAYS is applied.
 Step 2: Monitor subscription updates
 To receive a notification when a subscription status changes, such as when a charge is successful, subscribe to the GraphQL Admin API's APP_SUBSCRIPTION_UPDATE webhook topic.

 Update the maximum charge for a subscription
 Update the maximum amount that merchants can be charged for their subscription. You should do this if you change your pricing model.
 Note
 If you try to create a usage record for a usage pricing plan with an amount that's less than the new usage record, then the request fails. You need to increase the cappedAmount, and then obtain merchant approval before you can create more usage records.
 Requirements
 Your app can make authenticated requests to the GraphQL Admin API.
 Step 1: Retrieve charge data
 Make a request to the AppSubscription object for the following data:
 id
 cappedAmount
 The cappedAmount is the maximum that a merchant is billed for during the 30-day billing cycle. The currencyCode must be one of the supported currencies.
 balanceUsed
 The following query is an example:
 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/latest/graphql.json
 GraphQL query
 1 query {
 2
    node(id: "gid://shopify/AppSubscription/4019585080") {
 3
      ...on AppSubscription {
 4
        lineItems {
 5
          plan {
 6
            pricingDetails {
 7
              ...on AppUsagePricing {
 8
                terms
 9
                cappedAmount {
 10
                  amount
 11
                  currencyCode
 12
                }
 13
                balanceUsed {
 14
                  amount
 15
                  currencyCode
 16
                }
 17
              }
 18
            }
 19
          }
 20
        }
 21
      }

 Step 2: Update the capped amount

 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/latest/graphql.json
 GraphQL mutation
 1 mutation {
 2
    appSubscriptionLineItemUpdate(
 3
      id: "${AppSubscriptionLineItemUsagePricing_gid}"
 4
      cappedAmount: { amount: 100.00, currencyCode: USD }
 5
    ) {

      userErrors {

 11
      appSubscription {
 12
        id
 13
      }
 14
    }
 15 }
 JSON response

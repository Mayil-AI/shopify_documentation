 Getting started with POS UI extensions
 This tutorial shows you how to set up your development environment so that you can begin developing a POS UI extension.
 What you'll learn
 In this tutorial, you'll learn how to do the following tasks:
 Generate a POS UI extension using Shopify CLI.
 Run the local extension in your development store.
 Test your app in Shopify POS.
 Requirements
 Create a development store.
 Install or migrate to Shopify CLI version 3.0 or higher.
 Create an app.
 Embed your app in Shopify POS.
 Step 1: Generate a POS UI Extension
 Navigate to your app directory.
 Ensure @shopify/cli and @shopify/app packages are using the most up to date versions.
 Terminal
 npm
 Yarn
 pnpm
 $ npm run shopify upgrade
 Generate your POS UI extension template.
 Terminal
 npm
 Yarn
 pnpm
 $ npm run generate extension
 Select POS UI under the Point-of-Sale menu.
 Give your extension a working name.
 Select the programming language that you want to work in.
 Step 2: Run the local extension in your development store
 After you create your extension, you can start a local development server so that you can run your extension in your development store.
 When you start the server, Shopify CLI uses Cloudflare to create a secure tunnel. Cloudflare gives your app extension a unique URL.
 Install your project's dependencies using the command from your package manager of choice.
 Terminal
 npm
 Yarn
 pnpm
 $ npm install
 Start your local server for your extension in the app directory.
 Terminal
 npm
 Yarn
 pnpm
 $ npm run dev
 Follow the prompts to associate your extension with your app and development store. Your development server should now be running.
 To learn more about the processes that execute when you run dev, refer to the list of Shopify CLI commands.
 Step 3: Install your app and preview your extension
 You can install your app and preview your extension in Shopify POS from the developer console.
 With your server running, press p to open the developer console.
 In the developer console page, complete the following tasks:
 To install your app, click on the preview link for the POS UI extension.
 To preview your extension, select the View mobile button. This generates a deep link or QR code.
 Using a mobile device with the Shopify POS app installed, scan the QR code that was generated from your developer console. This opens Shopify POS on your device, and installs the extension. If your extension's URL changes, then you need to re-add the smart grid extension tile.
 Tip
 If you're using Android and your extension isn't loading, then refer to the troubleshooting guide.

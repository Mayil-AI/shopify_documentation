 All Customer account UI extensions components
 Card
 Group related content and functionality together in a familiar and consistent style, for customers to scan, read, and get things done.
 CustomerAccountAction
 A modal to complete an order action flow. This component can only be used to populate the customer-account.order.action.render extension target, which renders as a result of the customer clicking the order action button rendered via the extension target.
 ImageGroup
 Display up to 4 images in a grid or stacked layout. For example, images of products in a wishlist or subscription. When there are more than 4 images, the component indicates how many more images are not displayed.
 Page
 The outer wrapper of the page—including the page title, subtitle, and page-level actions—displayed in a familiar and consistent style that sets expectations about the purpose of the page.
 ResourceItem
 Use to represent a specific object within a collection, that a customer can take action on. For example, a list of active subscriptions or redeemable offers, in a style consistent with the order index page.

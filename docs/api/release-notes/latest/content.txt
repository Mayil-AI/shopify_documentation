 What's new in 2024-04
 The 2024-04 version of Shopify's APIs includes the following highlights:
 Storefront API
 Storefront API Checkout mutations, queries, and types, as well as the REST Admin API Checkout resource are deprecated and will be sunset on April 1, 2025. Instead, you can build custom experiences on Web and Mobile with the Cart API and Checkout Sheet.
 Before version 2024-04 is released, we'll release a guide to help you migrate your apps, additional functionality to cover existing use cases, and more. Future functionality includes gift card support, dynamic shipping, and wallet support for headless experiences and mobile apps.
 GraphQL Admin API
 The GraphQL Admin API now includes new product types that support up to 2000 variants, increasing per-product variant support from our historical maximum of 100. As part of these changes, GraphQL types and REST resources for managing product variants and options are deprecated.
 All public apps that are built on existing GraphQL product APIs or REST product APIs must migrate to the new GraphQL product APIs by February 1, 2025.
 Custom apps that are built using the existing GraphQL product APIs must migrate to the new GraphQL product APIs by April 1, 2025.
 Custom apps that are built on REST will also need to migrate if they need to support more than 100 variants.
 Custom apps that don't need to support more than 100 variants can continue to use the deprecated REST product APIs. However, please note the following:
 Developers should expect that the GraphQL API will be the only supported API over the long term and will be made aware of these timelines as they become available.
 The deprecated REST product APIs are in maintenance mode. All new features and support will be built only for the new GraphQL product APIs.
 Any merchant using custom apps that are built with these deprecated APIs will not be able to increase their variant limit past 100.
 Breaking changes
 These changes require special attention. If your app uses these API resources, and you donâ€™t adjust your usage of the resources according to the following instructions, then your app might break when you update to this API version.
 Count field unification
 Fields that returned a count of resources are removed and replaced with new count fields that have consistent API design and improved features. Count fields are now standalone fields with a common naming pattern and their own arguments instead of being a field under a connection type.
 Inventory mutations and fields removal
 The following fields and mutations are removed:
 InventoryLevel.available
 InventoryLevel.incoming
 InventoryLevel.deactivationAlertHtml
 Mutation.InventoryAdjustQuantity
 Mutation.InventoryBulkAdjustQuantityAtLocation
 Replace InventoryLevel.available and InventoryLevel.incoming with InventoryLevel.quantities.
 Replace InventoryLevel.deactivationAlertHtml with InventoryLevel.deactivationAlert.
 Replace Mutation.InventoryAdjustQuantity and Mutation.InventoryBulkAdjustQuantityAtLocation with Mutation.AdjustQuantities or Mutation.MoveQuantities.
 Locale fields on MarketWebPresence
 The following fields on the MarketWebPresence object no longer return locale strings and instead make use of the ShopLocale type:
 defaultLocale
 alternateLocales
 Update your API calls using MarketWebPresence.defaultLocale or MarketWebPresence.alternateLocales to use the ShopLocale type.
 New create fulfillment request validation
 As of the GraphQL and REST Admin API versions 2024-04, you can't have multiples of the same fulfillment_order_id within the following:
 line_items_by_fulfillment_order parameter, for POST calls to the REST Admin API to create a fulfillment for one or many fulfillment orders.
 The GraphQL Admin API's fulfillmentCreateV2 mutation.
 Instead, you must combine any payload with the same fulfillment_order_id into one group.
 OrderTransaction.receipt deprecation
 The OrderTransaction.receipt field has been removed, and is replaced by receiptJson.
 Payment and billing error codes and mapping
 Payment error codes and mappings have changed. For detailed information on the changes, refer to the changelog.
 Sunset of productDuplicateAsync mutation, GraphQL Admin API
 We've removed the productDuplicateAsync mutation, which has been deprecated since version 2023-07, from the GraphQL Admin API.
 Use the productDuplicateAsyncV2 mutation instead.

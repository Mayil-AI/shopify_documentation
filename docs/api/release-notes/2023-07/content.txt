 Breaking changes
 These changes require special attention. If your app uses these API resources, and you donâ€™t adjust your usage of the resources according to the following instructions, then your app might break when you update to this API version.
 Deprecating creation of application credits through the Admin API
 Creating app credits through the Admin API is now deprecated. This affects both the REST resource and the GraphQL mutation.
 Moving forward, create app credits using the new appCreditCreate mutation in the Partner API. This change will now allow Partners to issue credits to stores that have uninstalled their app.
 Learn more about awarding app credits.
 Breaking changes to the product_feeds webhook topics
 The following major changes have been introduced to the product_feeds webhook topics:
 Deprecation of the use of bulk in favour of full for the product_feeds/full_sync webhook topic. To continue receiving full sync notifications, use the productFullSync mutation instead of productBulkSync.
 The spelling of the occurred_at field in the metadata for product_feeds notifications has been corrected.
 Creation of region-specific subfolders on country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs)
 You can now create region-specific subfolders on ccTLDs such as shop.ca or shop.fr. This is a departure from the previous behaviour where subfolders could only be created on generic top-level domains (gTLDs).
 New error code added to inventory quantity mutations
 The error code item_not_stocked_at_location has been added to the inventorySetOnHandQuantities, inventoryAdjustQuantities, and inventoryMoveQuantities mutations. This error code is returned when you attempt to change inventory quantities for an item that isn't stocked at the specified location.
 No automatic creation of a subfolder web presence for a single-country market
 As of API version 2023-07, a subfolder web presence for a single-country market is no longer automatically created.
 To maintain the existing functionality, use the marketWebPresenceCreate mutation following the creation of a market. Passing the country code of the market region as the subfolderSuffix will create the corresponding web presence.
 Mandatory provision of the chargebackLiability field in the Payments Apps API
 As of version 2023-07 of the Payments Apps API, the chargebackLiability field must be provided in the 3-D Secure PaymentSessionThreeDSecureAuthenticationData input object. This change allows merchants to better manage their orders.
 Learn more about the Payments Apps API and 3-D Secure.
 Removal of the delivery_category field on order shipping lines
 As of API version 2023-07, we're deprecating the order shipping line delivery_category property. The property hasn't been in use since 2020-06-12 and will no longer be present.
 Translate filter settings
 As of API version 2023-07, we're introducing a new capability to translate filters.
 When enabled, all filter labels will be eligible for translations through the Translations API as well as the Translate and Adapt app.
 Use of Flow action extensions to update marketing activity delivery status
 We're deprecating the abandonmentEmailStateUpdate mutation. Instead, you can use the abandonmentUpdateActivitiesDeliveryStatuses to update the delivery status of marketing activities created using a Flow action extension.
 Use of total_count on CustomerSegmentMemberConnection endpoint
 You can now use total_count on the CustomerSegmentMemberConnection endpoint, which provides the total count of a specified customer segment. Additionally, the total_count field on SegmentStatistics object has been removed. The new total_count functionality makes it easier to know the count of members of a specified segment.

 Breaking changes
 These changes require special attention. If your app uses these API resources, and you donâ€™t adjust your usage of the resources according to the following instructions, then your app might break when you update to this API version.
 Change to AppSubscriptionDiscountInput
 The durationLimitInIntervals field on the AppSubscriptionDiscountInput input object no longer accepts 0 as a value.
 To create a discount with an unlimited duration, don't specify the durationLimitInIntervals field.
 Field deprecation on ProductInput
 We've deprecated the images field on the ProductInput input object.
 Use the media argument on the productCreate and productUpdate mutations instead.
 Field removals on ProductVariantInput
 We've removed the deprecated imageId and imageSrc fields from the ProductVariantInput input object.
 Use the mediaId and mediaSrc fields instead.
 Field removal on the Shipping Discount Function API
 We've removed the deprecated discountApplicationStrategy field on the FunctionRunResult object, and its predecessor, the FunctionResult object.
 The discount application strategy for shipping discount functions is always considered to be ALL. This means that all applicable discounts are returned by a shipping discount function.
 Handle as a scalar type on Shopify Function APIs
 The following fields and arguments that return a handle to identify a Function resource now use the appropriate Handle scalar as their type:
 Fields and arguments that use as a scalar type
 Name Type Change

 utcOffset and isCumulative are now required fields on the marketingEngagementInput input object.
 The fetchedAt field has been removed from the marketingEngagementInput input object.
 The utm field has been deprecated from the MarketingActivityUpdateExternalInput input object.
 Marketing fields and properties removals
 GraphQL Admin API: We've removed the following deprecated fields on the Customer object and CustomerInput input object:

 Use the emailMarketingConsent field instead.
 REST Admin API: We've removed the following deprecated properties on the Order and Customer resources:

 marketing_opt_in_level
 Use the email_marketing_consent property instead.
 Subscription billing attempts
 The SubscriptionBillingAttemptCreate mutation now prevents the creation of billing attempts if a subscription contract has one of the following terminal statuses:
 EXPIRED
 CANCELLED
 STALE
 We've also added the CONTRACT_TERMINATED error code to the BillingAttemptUserErrorCode enum. This new error code is returned in the case where billing attempt creation is prevented.
 Learn how to schedule and automate the billing of subscriptions.
 Subscription contracts
 The STALE value on the SubscriptionContractSubscriptionStatus enum has been removed. Existing subscription contracts with the STALE status will be returned as CANCELLED, and you won't be able to update the status of a subscription contract to STALE.
 Use the EXPIRED or CANCELLED values instead.

 Example
 The following example shows an input query:
 input.graphql
 1 query Input {
 2
    cart {
 3
      cost {
 4
        subtotalAmount {
 5
          amount
 6
          currencyCode
 7
        }
 8
      }
 9
    }
 10
    paymentMethods {
 11
      id
 12
    }
 13 }
 The following example shows the resulting input to the query:
 input.json
 1 {
 2
    "cart": {
 3
      "cost": {
 4
        "subtotalAmount": {
 5
          "amount": 200,
 6
          "currencyCode": "CAD"
 7
        }
 8
      }
 9
    },
 10
    "paymentMethods": {
 11
      "id": "gid://shopify/PaymentCustomizationPaymentMethod/1"
 12
    }
 13 }

      "hide": {

        "paymentMethodId": "gid://shopify/PaymentCustomizationPaymentMethod/1"

 Shipping Discount API reference
 The Shipping Discount API enables you to create a new type of discount that is applied to one or more shipping rates at checkout.
 Extension targets
 The Shipping Discount API exposes the following targets:
 Target Output type Description
 purchase.shipping-discount.run FunctionRunResult Outputs the shipping rate discounts
 Input
 The RunInput object is the complete schema that your function can receive as input.
 For a list of fields that the Shipping Discount API's Input object accepts, refer to Input.
 Example
 The following example shows an input query:
 input.graphql
 1 query Input {
 2
    cart {
 3
      deliveryGroups {
 4
        id
 5
        deliveryOptions {
 6
          handle
 7
          title
 8
        }
 9
        selectedDeliveryOption {
 10
          handle
 11
          title
 12
        }
 13
      }
 14
    }
 15 }
 The following example shows the resulting input to the query:
      "deliveryGroups": [
 4
        {
 5
          "id": "gid://shopify/CartDeliveryGroup/0",
 6
          "deliveryOptions": [
 7
            {
 8
              "handle": "handle0-standard",
 9
              "title": "Standard"
 10
            },
 11
            {
 12
              "handle": "handle1-express",
 13
              "title": "Express"
 14
            }
 15
          ]
 16
        }
 17
      ]
 18
    }
 19 }
 FunctionRunResult
 The FunctionRunResult object is the expected output for the purchase.shipping-discount.run target.
 Unlike other discount Function APIs, the Shipping Discount Functions API FunctionRunResult object doesn't have a DiscountApplicationStrategy field. Instead, all discounts included in the FunctionRunResult are applied, as long as each of these discounts target the same shipping rate no more than once, whether by targeting it specifically using DeliveryOptionTarget or generally using DeliveryGroupTarget. The FunctionRunResult is ignored if individual shipping rates are targeted more than once.
 Example
 The following function result includes one free shipping discount for the Standard shipping rate:
 output.json
 1 {
 2
    "discounts": [
 3
      {
 4
        "value": {
 5
          "percentage": {
 6
            "value": "100"
 7
          }
 8
        },
 9
        "targets": [
 10
          {
 11
            "deliveryOption": {
 12
              "handle": "handle0-standard"
 13
            }
 14
          }
 15
        ],
 16
        "message": "100% off Standard shipping"
 17
      }
 18
    ]
 19 }

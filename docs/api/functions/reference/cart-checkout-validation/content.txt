 Cart and Checkout Validation Function API overview
 The Validation API allows developers to provide their own validation of a cart and checkout, including express checkouts, such as PayPal, Shop Pay, Google Pay, and Apple Pay.
 Note
 Errors from Validation functions are exposed to the Storefront API's Cart object, in themes using the cart template and during checkout.
 Example use cases
 Use tokengating or require a customer membership at checkout.
 Verify the age or ID of a customer when they proceed through checkout.
 Provide B2B product minimums, maximums, and multiples.
 Provide B2B location order minimums, maximums, or credit limits.
 Specify quantity limits in a flash sale.

 Limitations and considerations
 The Validation API doesn't currently support draft orders.
 Validation functions are cached. This can result in a delay (typically, less than one minute) between changes being made and those changes being live.

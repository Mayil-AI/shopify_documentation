 Fulfillment Constraints API reference
 The Fulfillment Constraints API enables you to have a higher degree of customization when defining fulfillment and delivery strategies.
 Extension targets
 The Fulfillment Constraints API exposes the following targets:
 Target Output type Description
 purchase.fulfillment-constraint-rule.run FunctionRunResult Outputs a list of fulfillment constraints
 Input
 The RunInput object is the complete schema that your function can receive as input.
 For a list of fields that the Fulfillment Constraints API's Input object accepts, refer to Input.
 Example
 The following example shows an input query:
 input.graphql
 1 query Input {
 2
    locations {
 3
      id
 4
      name
 5
      address1
 6
      someMetafield: metafield(namespace: "some-namespace", key: "some-key") {
 7
        value
 The following example shows the resulting input to the query:
 input.json
 1 {
 2
    "locations": [
 3
      {
 4
        "id": "gid://shopify/Location/1",
 5
        "name": "Shopify Ottawa Office",
 6
        "address1": "150 Elgin St",
 7
        "someMetafield": {
 8
          "value": "some-value"
 9
        }
 10
      }
 11
    ]
 12 }
 FunctionRunResult
 The FunctionRunResult object is the expected output for the purchase.fulfillment-constraint-rule.run target.
 Example
 Output objects can return a value of 0 to n fulfillment constraints. The following function result specifies that DeliverableCartLine 1 and 2 must ship or fulfill from same location, and lines 3 and 4 must ship or fulfill from locations 1 or 2:
 output.json
 1 {
 2
    "operations": [
 3
      {
 4
        "mustFulfillFromSameLocation": {
 5
          "deliverableLineIds": ["gid://shopify/DeliverableCartLine/1", "gid://shopify/DeliverableCartLine/2"]
 6
        }
 7
      },
 8
      {
 9
        "mustFulfillFrom": {
 10
          "deliverableLineIds": ["gid://shopify/DeliverableCartLine/3", "gid://shopify/DeliverableCartLine/4"],
 11
          "locationIds": ["gid://shopify/Location/1", "gid://shopify/Location/2"],
 12
        }
 13
      }
 14
    ]
 15 }
 Optionally, the deliverableLineIds key can be omitted from the constraint operation to indicate that the fulfillment constraint should be applied to all deliverable lines within the cart.
 output_2.json
 1 {
 2
    "operations": [
 3
      {
 4
        "mustFulfillFromSameLocation": {}
 5
      },
 6
      {
 7
        "mustFulfillFrom": {
 8
          "locationIds": ["gid://shopify/Location/1", "gid://shopify/Location/2"],
 9
        }
 10
      }
 11
    ]
 12 }
 Functions conflict
 In scenarios where FunctionRunResult returns constraints that are mutually exclusive, checkout won't return any shipping rates.
 Scenario 1
 In the following example, an item cannot be fulfilled by two locations.
 conflict_scenario_1.json
 1 {
 2
    "operations": [
 3
      {
 4
        "mustFulfillFrom": {
 5
          "deliverableLineIds": [
 6
            "gid://shopify/DeliverableCartLine/1",
 7
          ],
 8
          "locationIds": ["gid://shopify/Location/1"]
 9
        }
 10
      },
 11
      {
 12
        "mustFulfillFrom": {
 13
          "deliverableLineIds": [
 14
            "gid://shopify/DeliverableCartLine/1",
 15
          ],
 16
          "locationIds": ["gid://shopify/Location/2"]
 17
        }
 18
      }
 19
    ]
 20 }
 Scenario 2
 In the following example, DeliverableCartLine 1 and DeliverableCartLine 2 can't be fulfilled together because they must fulfill from Location 1 and 2 respectively.
 conflict_scenario_1.json
 1 {
 2
    "operations": [
 3
      {
 4
        "mustFulfillFrom": {
 5
          "deliverableLineIds": [
 6
            "gid://shopify/DeliverableCartLine/1",
 7
          ],
 8
          "locationIds": ["gid://shopify/Location/1"]
 9
        }
 10
      },
 11
      {
 12
        "mustFulfillFrom": {
 13
          "deliverableLineIds": [
 14
            "gid://shopify/DeliverableCartLine/2",
 15
          ],
 16
          "locationIds": ["gid://shopify/Location/2"]
 17
        }
 18
      },
 19
      {
 20
        "mustFulfillFromSameLocation": {
 21
          "deliverableLineIds": [
 22
            "gid://shopify/DeliverableCartLine/1",
 23
            "gid://shopify/DeliverableCartLine/2",
 24
          ]
 25
        }
 26
      }
 27
    ]
 28 }

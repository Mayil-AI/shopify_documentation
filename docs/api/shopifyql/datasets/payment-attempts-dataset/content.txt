 Payment Attempts dataset
 This page outlines the definition, type, and utility of each ShopifyQL column including numeric values, aggregates, and dimensional attributes.
 Notes about this dataset
 This dataset is available for Plus merchants only.
 The grain of this dataset is one row for each payment_attempt_group.
 A payment attempt group is defined as a sequence of payment attempts that meet all of the following criteria:
 Attempts were part of the same checkout
 Attempts used the same card, if card data is available
 Attempts were for the same amount of money, in the same currency
 Attempts used the same payment method
 Each attempt in the group was made no more than 30 minutes after the previous attempt
 The attempts were all failures, or ended in a success. If two sequential successes occur with all the same attributes, then they're treated as separate groups.
 Attempts are grouped to account for retried payments, allowing users to determine whether a customer eventually succeeded in making the purchase that they intended to make. This approach is based on the assumption that if a payment attempt group ends in a success, then the preceding failed attempts didn't result in a loss of revenue.
 Numeric values
 Numeric values are the base numbers in the dataset. Theyâ€™re typically aggregated using ShopifyQL functions like sum.
 Name Type Definition
 successful_attempts number The number of payment attempts in this group that were successful
 failed_attempts number The number of payment attempts in this group that were not successful
 customer_currency_amount price The amount of the attempted payment, in the currency used by the customer
 shop_currency_amount price The amount of the attempted payment, in the store's default currency
 Dimensional attributes
 Name Type Definition
 payment_attempt_group string A unique identifier for the group of payment attempts described by each row
 order_id number A unique idenfitier for the related order, if one exists
 card_bin_country string The country associated with the card bin
 card_bin string The first several digits of the card number used
 card_brand string The brand of the card that was used
 card_wallet string The card wallet that was used, if any
 payment_method string The payment method that was used
 funding_source string The source of funding behind the card used, such as debit or credit
 customer_currency string The currency used by the customer
 shop_currency string The default store currency
 first_attempted timestamp The time at which the earliest payment attempt in the group occurred
 last_attempted timestamp The time at which the latest payment attempt in the group occurred
 in_person_payment Boolean Whether the payment was made in person, for example, using a point of sale terminal
 Aggregates
 Aggregates are predefined calculations of numeric values, to replicate metrics that are available throughout Shopify. Aggregates can be grouped or filtered by any of the dimensional attributes.
 Name Type Definition
 authorization_rate percent The rate of successful payment authorization, adjusted for retries. Defined as sum(successful_attempts) / count(). To learn more about how retries are accounted for, refer to the dataset notes.
 raw_authorization_rate percent The rate of successful payment authorization, not adjusted for retries. Defined as sum(successful_attempts) / sum(successful_attempts + failed_attempts).
 Sample queries

 3 GROUP BY month
 4 SINCE -3m
 5 ORDER BY month
 Show payment authorization rate by payment_method
 1 FROM payment_attempts
 2 SHOW auth_rate, sum(successful_attempts + failed_attempts) AS total_attempts
 3 GROUP BY payment_method
 4 SINCE -3m
 5 ORDER BY total_attempts DESC

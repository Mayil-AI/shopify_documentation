 Orders dataset
 Use ShopifyQL to access the dataset to explore data about order value and volume.
 This page outlines the definition, type, and utility of each ShopifyQL column including numeric values, aggregates, and dimensional attributes.
 Notes about this dataset
 This dataset contains one order per row, and has data available starting August 1, 2018. Refunds, returns, and exchanges are captured, deleted orders are removed entirely. All gift card sale items are excluded from this dataset as well. This is because gift cards are considered a liability/payment method rather than actual goods/services sold. The date assigned to each order is the date of the first sales event within that order.
 All money values are shown in the registered currency of the shop. All metrics are fully additive, which means they are summable with any dimension in the dataset and are always the same.
 Numeric values
 Numeric values are the base numbers in the dataset. Theyâ€™re typically aggregated using ShopifyQL functions like sum.

 This dataset is available for Plus merchants.

 Sample Queries
 1. Show net sales by month
 Note
 The query will need to SUM() the net_sales metric. This is because the dataset contains net sales per order, and has to be aggregated.
 1 FROM orders SHOW sum(net_sales) AS monthly_net_sales
 2 GROUP BY month
 3 SINCE -3m
 4 ORDER BY month
 2. Show the number of orders per day over a time period
 1 FROM orders
 2 VISUALIZE sum(orders) AS orders
 3 TYPE line
 4 GROUP BY day
 5 SINCE last_month UNTIL yesterday LIMIT 100
 3. Show average order value per day over a time period
 1 FROM orders
 2 VISUALIZE average_order_value

 Hydrogen
 Hydrogen is Shopify’s opinionated stack for headless commerce, built on Remix. It provides a set of tools, utilities, and best-in-class examples for building dynamic and performant commerce applications.
 Setup
 Create a new Hydrogen project with your preferred package manager.
 Import components, hooks, or utilities that you want to use in your app. For more, see the getting started guide.
 Tutorial
 Getting started with Hydrogen and Oxygen
 Create a new Hydrogen project
 npm
 yarn
 npm create @shopify/hydrogen@latest
 Authentication
 To make full use of Hydrogen, you need to authenticate with and make requests to the Storefront API and the Customer Account API. Hydrogen includes full-featured API clients to securely handle API queries and mutations.
 You can create access tokens for your own Shopify store by installing the Hydrogen sales channel, which includes built-in support for Oxygen, Shopify’s global edge hosting platform. Or install the Headless sales channel to host your Hydrogen app anywhere.
 Both the Storefront API and Customer Account API offer public credentials for client-side applications.

 Versioning
 Hydrogen is tied to specific versions of the Storefront API, which is versioned quarterly. For example, if you're using Storefront API version 2023-10, then Hydrogen versions 2023.10.x are fully compatible.
 Caution
 If a Storefront API version includes breaking changes, then the corresponding Hydrogen version will include the same breaking changes.

 API release notes
 How Hydrogen works with Hydrogen React
 Hydrogen is built on Remix. But many of the components, hooks and utilities built into Hydrogen come from Hydrogen React, an underlying package that’s framework-agnostic. For convenience, the Hydrogen package re-exports those resources. This means that if you’re building a Hydrogen app, then you should import modules from the @shopify/hydrogen package.
 Importing Hydrogen components
 example-page.jsx
 1 import {ShopPayButton} from '@shopify/hydrogen';
 2
 3 export function renderShopPayButton({variantId, storeDomain}) {
 4
    return <ShopPayButton variantIds={[variantId]} storeDomain={storeDomain} />;
 5 }

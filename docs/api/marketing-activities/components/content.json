 Marketing activities components reference
 The form that's associated with a marketing activity app extension is generated based on a set of components that you choose when you create it. Components are configurable pieces of UI that you can use to build out the specific functionality that your app requires. Although a form is generated based on the components that you choose, you can't customize its styling, layout, or workflows directly.
 To learn how to create a form for your app, refer to Getting started with marketing activities.
 How it works
 When an app user interacts with your marketing activity, Shopify calls your marketing activity preload endpoint to render the field values that your app provides. To do this Shopify uses the components in JSON format, as defined in this document. The JSON format is also used for your app's other endpoints such as create and update.
 Preload endpoint JSON output schema
 Responses from your app's preload endpoint include the form_data at the top level with field_name and property key value pairs.
 1 {
 2
    "form_data": {
 3
      "<field_name>": {
 4
        "<property_key>": "<property_value>"
 5
      }
 6
    }
 7 }
 For the dynamic standalone endpoint, responses from your app include component_data at the top level. Refer to the typeahead component for more information.
 1 {
 2
    "component_data": {
 3
      "options": [
 4
        {
 5
          "label": "<option_label>",
 6
          "value": "<option_value>"
 7
        }
 8
      ]
 9
    }
 10 }
 Create or update JSON input schema
 When a user creates or updates a marketing activity, Shopify calls your app by sending the properties object with the included field names and corresponding values.
 1 {
 2
    ...
 3
    "properties": {
 4
      "<field_name>": "<value>"
 5
    }
 6 }

 List of Webhook Topics
 Deprecated API calls
 Webhook
 You can use webhook subscriptions to receive notifications about particular events in a shop. After you've subscribed to a webhook topic, your app can execute code immediately after specific events occur in shops that have your app installed, instead of having to make API calls periodically to check their status.
 For example, you can rely on webhooks to trigger an action in your app when a customer creates a cart, or when a merchant creates a new product in their Shopify admin. By using webhooks, you can make fewer API calls overall, which makes sure that your apps are more efficient and update quickly.
 For more information on how webhooks work and how to test them, refer to Webhooks overview and Webhook testing.
 Considerations
 If you create a webhook subscription through the Shopify admin, then that subscription won't be returned in API calls. These webhook subscriptions are associated solely to the shop, so the API can't access them.
 Webhook subscriptions are scoped only to the app that they're registered to. This means that when a webhook subscription is registered to an app, other apps can't view, modify, or delete it.
 To learn how to verify webhooks, refer to Verify the webhook.
 Mandatory webhooks
 Apps must subscribe to certain webhooks topics. You create mandatory webhooks either via the Partner Dashboard or by updating the app configuration TOML
 .
 Topic Event
 customers/data_request Requests to view stored customer data
 customers/redact Requests to delete customer data

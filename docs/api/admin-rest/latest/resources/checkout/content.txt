 Checkout
 Multiple access scopes needed â€” refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.
 Requires access to protected customer data.
 If you're building an app with the Sales Channel SDK, then you can use the Checkout API to let customers purchase products from Shopify stores that have installed your sales channel.
 Shopify uses the Checkout resource to manage a user's cart as it transitions to a paid order. This process includes specifying which line items are included in the checkout, attaching a customer's shipping and payment details, and calculating tax and shipping rates. Credit card payments can be attached to a Checkout using the Payment resource.
 Note
 You can't use the Checkout API to create a new checkout user experience for an individual store. For that you need to use an SDK that's powered by the Storefront API instead, such as the JavaScript Buy, iOS Buy, and Android Buy SDKs.

 GET
 Retrieves a list of shipping rates
 Retrieves a list of available shipping rates for the specified checkout. Implementers need to poll this endpoint until rates become available. Each shipping rate contains the checkout's new subtotal price, total tax, and total price in the event that this shipping rate is selected. This can be used to update the UI without performing further API requests. To apply a shipping rate, update the checkout's shipping line with the handle of the selected rate.

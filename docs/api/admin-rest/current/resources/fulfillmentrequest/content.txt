 FulfillmentRequest
 Multiple access scopes needed â€” refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.
 The FulfillmentRequest resource represents a fulfillment request made by the merchant or an order management app to a fulfillment service for a fulfillment order. A fulfillment service can accept or reject the fulfillment request.
 Terminating a fulfillment request
 A fulfillment service can stop fulfilling an accepted fulfillment request if they choose closing the fulfillment order as incomplete. The fulfillment order can be partially fulfilled when a fulfillment service chooses to stop the fulfillment.
 The merchant or an order management app can notify the fulfillment service to cancel an accepted fulfillment request by sending a cancellation request. The fulfillment service can accept or reject the cancellation request. The fulfillment order can be partially fulfilled at this time.
 The merchant or an order management app can also cancel a fulfillment order. Calling the cancel endpoint results in the fulfilment order being cancelled within Shopify. This change will not be communicated to the fulfilment service. If the intention is for a fulfilment service to halt fulfilment activity, a cancellation request should be sent to the fulfilment service instead, as described above.
 Retrieving fulfillment request details
 The FulfillmentOrder resource and the merchant_requests field can be used to retrieve the merchant requests which have been made. The overall status of these requests is also available using the request_status field of the fulfillment order.
 To learn more about the fulfillment request process in the fulfillment workflow, refer to Manage fulfillments as a fulfillment service app guide.

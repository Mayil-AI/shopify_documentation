 Payment
 Multiple access scopes needed â€” refer to each endpoint for access scope requirements.
 Requires access to protected customer data.
 Note
 Sales channels require elevated permissions to interact with the Payment resource. For more information, see Request payment processing.
 The Payment resource allows sales channels to build a fully native checkout experience by submitting a customer's payment details directly to Shopify.
 To complete a payment using the Payment resource, first create a payment session by submitting the card details to Shopify's card vault in exchange for a session ID. The session ID can then be used to create a payment for an existing Checkout.
 The Payment resource is compatible only with direct payment gateways. For a list of all supported payment gateways, see Direct and external credit card payment providers.

 Summary Card
 The SummaryCard component displays basic information about the state of a discount and can display more advanced configuration options if any OptionalSectionsProps are passed. None, any, or all optional sections can be displayed. We recommend displaying as many sections as you have data for, in order to give as much information to the user about their discount as possible.

 GraphQL variables
 You can simplify GraphQL queries and mutations by extracting data into separate variables. GraphQL variables let you reuse the same requests with different arguments.
 Variable structure
 GraphQL requests can be split into query and variable sections.
 Query section
 In the query section, GraphQL variables begin with the $ symbol and are declared after the query or mutation keyword, similar to passing an argument to a function.
 When you declare a variable, you need to specify its type, such as CustomerInput. This lets GraphQL know that you intend to refer to this type by this variable name later in the actual query.
 For example, the following query declares an $input variable and passes it to the input argument:
 GraphQL mutation with an input variable
 1 mutation($input: CustomerInput!) {
 2
    customerCreate(input: $input) { ... }
 3 }
 Variable section
 In the variable section, variables are defined as a JSON object.
 The following JSON object defines the $input variable for the query section:
 Input variables
 1 {
 2
    "input": {
 3
      "firstName": "Ayumu",
 4
      "lastName": "Hirano",
 5
      "email": "ayumu@example.com"
 6
    }
 7 }
 Simplify the customer creation request
 The following example simplifies the customerCreate mutation example by using variables, resulting in an abstracted mutation that can be reused to create multiple customers.
 POST /admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json
 GraphQL mutation
 1 mutation ($input: CustomerInput!) {
 2
    customerCreate(input: $input)
 3
    {
 4
      customer {
 5
        id
 6
        displayName
 7
      }
 8
      userErrors {
 9
        field
 10
        message
 11
      }
 12
    }
 13 }
 Input variables
 1 {
 2
    "input": {
 3
      "firstName": "Ayumu",
 4
      "lastName": "Hirano",
 5
      "email": "ayumu@example.com"
 6
    }
 7 }
 JSON response
 1 {
 2
    "data": {
 3
      "customerCreate": {
 4
        "customer": {
 5
          "id": "gid://shopify/Customer/1310038130710",
 6
          "displayName": "Ayumu Hirano"
 7
        },
 8
        "userErrors": []
 9
      }
 10
    }
 11
    ...
 12 }

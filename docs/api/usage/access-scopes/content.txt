Product subscription app extensions
 Shopify API access scopes
 All apps need to request access to specific store data during the app authorization process. This guide provides a complete list of available access scopes for the Admin, Storefront, and Payment Apps APIs.
 How it works
 Tip
 For more information on how to configure your access scopes, refer to app configuration.
 After you've generated API credentials, your app needs to be authorized to access store data.
 Authorization is the process of giving permissions to apps. Users can authorize Shopify apps to access data in a store. For example, an app might be authorized to access orders and product data in a store.
 An app can request authenticated or unauthenticated access scopes.

 Authenticated access is intended for interacting with a store on behalf of a user.

 Requesting specific permissions
 Follow the procedures below to request specific permissions to request access scopes in the Partner Dashboard.
 Orders permissions
 By default, you have access to the last 60 days' worth of orders for a store. To access all the orders, you need to request access to the read_all_orders scope from the user:
 From the Partner Dashboard, go to Apps.
 Click the name of your app.
 Click API access.
 In the Access requests section, on the Read all orders scope card, click Request access.
 On the Orders page that opens, describe your app and why you’re applying for access.
 Click Request access.
 If Shopify approves your request, then you can add the read_all_orders scope to your app along with read_orders or write_orders.
 Subscription APIs permissions
 Subscription apps let users sell subscription products that generate multiple orders on a specific billing frequency.
 With subscription products, the app user isn't required to get customer approval for each subsequent order after the initial subscription purchase. As a result, your app needs to request the required protected access scopes to use Subscription APIs from the app user:
 From the Partner Dashboard, go to Apps.
 Click the name of your app.
 Click API access.
 In the Access requests section, on the Access Subscriptions APIs card, click Request access.
 On the Subscriptions page that opens, describe why you’re applying for access.
 Click Request access.
 If Shopify approves your request, then you can add the read_customer_payment_methods and write_own_subscription_contracts scopes to your app.
 Protected customer data permissions
 By default, apps don't have access to any protected customer data. To access protected customer data, you must meet our protected customer data requirements. You can add the relevant scopes to your app, but the API won't return data from non-development stores until your app is configured and approved for protected customer data use.
 Unauthenticated access scopes
 Unauthenticated access scopes provide apps with read-only access to the Storefront API. Unauthenticated access is intended for interacting with a store on behalf of a customer. For example, an app might need to do one or more of following tasks:
 Read products and collections
 Create customers and update customer accounts
 Query international prices for products and orders
 Interact with a cart during a customer's session
 Initiate a checkout
 Request scopes
 To request unauthenticated access scopes for an app, select them when you generate API credentials or change granted access scopes.
 To request access scopes or permissions for the Headless channel, refer to managing the Headless channel.
 You can request the following unauthenticated access scopes:
 Unauthenticated access scopes
 Scope Access
 unauthenticated_read_checkouts,
 unauthenticated_write_checkouts
 Checkout object
 unauthenticated_read_customers,
 unauthenticated_write_customers
 Customer object
 unauthenticated_read_customer_tags tags field on the Customer object
 unauthenticated_read_content Storefront content, such as Article, Blog, and Comment objects
 unauthenticated_read_metaobjects View metaobjects, such as Metaobject
 unauthenticated_read_product_inventory quantityAvailable field on the ProductVariant object and totalAvailable field on the Product object
 unauthenticated_read_product_listings Product and Collection objects
 unauthenticated_read_product_pickup_locations Location and StoreAvailability objects
 unauthenticated_read_product_tags tags field on the Product object
 unauthenticated_read_selling_plans Selling plan content on the Product object
 Customer access scopes
 Customer access scopes provide apps with read and write access to the Customer Account API. Customer access is intended for interacting with data that belongs to a customer. For example, an app might need to do one or more of following tasks:
 Read customers orders
 Update customer accounts
 Create and update customer addresses
 Read shop, customer or order metafields
 Request scopes
 To request access scopes or permissions for the Headless or Hydrogen channel, refer to managing permissions.
 You can request the following customer access scopes:
 Customer access scopes
 Scope Access
 customer_read_customers,
 customer_write_customers
 Customer object
 customer_read_orders Order object
 customer_read_draft_orders Draft Order object
 customer_read_markets Market object
 Checking granted access scopes
 You can check your app’s granted access scopes using the GraphQL Admin API or REST Admin API.

 Limitations and considerations
 Apps should request only the minimum amount of data that's necessary for an app to function when using a Shopify API. Shopify restricts access to scopes for apps that don't require legitimate use of the associated data.
 Only public or custom apps are granted access scopes. Legacy app types, such as private or unpublished, won't be granted new access scopes.

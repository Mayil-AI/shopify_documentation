 Global IDs in Shopify APIs
 Shopify's GraphQL APIs use global IDs to refer to objects. A global ID is an application-wide uniform resource identifier (URI) that uniquely identifies an object. You can use a global ID to retrieve a specific Shopify object of any type.
 How it works
 To enable GraphQL clients to neatly handle caching and data refetching, GraphQL servers expose object identifiers in a standardized way using the Relay specification.
 Relay asks for a compliant server to expose a standard mechanism for fetching any object given an ID. These objects are referred as nodes and they implement the Node interface. Shopify's GraphQL APIs provide a versionable implementation of this interface.
 Global ID structure
 Shopify uses GlobalID to encode global IDs. By default, when implementing a Node interface, a type's id field constructs a global ID with the following structure:
 Global ID structure
 gid://shopify/{object_name}/{id}
 For example, a Product object with the ID 123 would resolve to the following global ID:
 Global ID of a Product object
 gid://shopify/Product/123
 Parameterized global IDs
 Some objects are more complex and have global IDs that contain parameters. A global ID with parameters has the following structure:
 Parameterized global ID structure
 gid://shopify/{child_object_name}/{child_object_id}?{parent_object_name}_id={parent_object_id}
 For example, the InventoryLevel object is associated with the InventoryItem object. If the InventoryLevel object's ID is 123 and the InventoryItem object's ID is 456, then the global ID would resolve to the following structure:
 Parameterized global ID for InventoryLevel object
 gid://shopify/InventoryLevel/123?inventory_item_id=456
 Global ID examples
 The following table provides some common examples of global IDs that are associated with different GraphQL objects. For example purposes, each global ID is referenced as 123.

 Querying global IDs
 A node is an object that has a global ID and is of a type that's defined by the schema. Connections retrieve a list of nodes. For example, the products connection finds all the Product type nodes connected to the query root.
 The following example shows how to use the GraphQL Admin API to query the global IDs of the first 5 products in your store:
 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json
 GraphQL query
 1 {
 2
    products(first:5) {
 3
      edges {
        }
 7
      }
 8
    }
 3
      "products": {
 4
        "edges": [
 5
          {
 6
            "node": {
 7
              "id": "gid://shopify/Product/1"
 8
            }
 9
          },
 10
          {
 11
            "node": {
 12
              "id": "gid://shopify/Product/2"
 13
            }
 14
          },
 15
          {
 16
            "node": {
 17
              "id": "gid://shopify/Product/3"
 18
            }
 19
          },
 20
          {
 21
            "node": {
 22
              "id": "gid://shopify/Product/4"
 23
            }
 24
          },
 25
          {
 26
            "node": {
 27
              "id": "gid://shopify/Product/5"
 28
            }
 29
          }
 30
        ]
 31
      }
 32
    }
 33 }
 Retrieving global IDs through the UI
 Some global IDs can be quickly retrieved through the user interface (UI). For example, you can find a product's global ID from your Shopify admin by clicking Products and clicking a specific product. The URL of the page contains the product's global ID:
 Page URL containing the global ID of a product
 https://admin.shopify.com/store/{shop}/products/{id}
 Using global IDs in mutations
 Many mutations in Shopify's GraphQL APIs require an id input field. The value of the id field needs to be constructed as a global ID.
 The following example shows how to use an id input field to update a product's status:
 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json
 GraphQL query
 1 mutation {
 2
    productUpdate(input: {id: "gid://shopify/Product/3", title: "Burton Custom Freestyle 151", status: "ARCHIVED"} ) {
 3
      product {
 4
        id
 5
        status
 6
      }
 7
    }
 8 }
 JSON response
 1 {
 2
    "data": {
 3
      "productUpdate": {
 4
        "product": {
 5
          "id": "gid://shopify/Product/3",
 6
          "status": "ARCHIVED"
 7
        }
 8
      }
 9
    }
 10 }
 Simple IDs
 Shopify's REST Admin API contains simple IDs, which differ from global IDs. A simple ID is a unique series of numbers that identifies a REST resource:
 Simple ID example
 1 "id": 123456789
 For example, the REST Admin API's DiscountCode resource includes an id property that has a simple ID as a value:
 DiscountCode resource
 1 {
 2
    "code": "SUMMERSALE10OFF",
 3
    "created_at": "2022-03-13T16:09:54-04:00",
 4
    "updated_at": "2022-03-13T16:09:54-04:00",
 5
    "id": 9808080986,
 6
    ...
 7 }
 Simple IDs also exist for properties that have descriptive names appended by id. For example, the REST Admin API's GiftCard resource includes the following properties that each have a simple ID as a value:
 GiftCard resource
 1 {
 2
    "api_client_id": 123456789,
 3
    "customer_id": 234567890,
 4
    "line_item_id": 345678901,
 5
    "order_id": 456789012,
 6
    "user_id": 567890123,
 7
    ...
 8 }
 Most REST Admin API resources include an admin_graphql_api_id property, which provides a global ID for the equivalent object in the GraphQL Admin API. For example, the following two properties on the Customer resource are equivalent:
 Customer resource
 1 {
 2
    "id": 123456789, // A simple ID for a Customer resource in the REST Admin API
 3
    "admin_graphql_api_id": "gid://shopify/Customer/123456789" // A global ID for the equivalent Customer object in the GraphQL Admin API
 4 }
 Similarly, most GraphQL Admin API objects include a legacyResourceId field, which provides a simple ID for the equivalent resource in the REST Admin API. For example, the following two fields on the Product object are equivalent:
 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/{api_version}/graphql.json
 GraphQL query
 1 {
 2
    products(first:5) {
 3
      edges {
 4
        node {
 5
          id # A global ID for the Product object in the GraphQL Admin API
 6
          legacyResourceId  # A simple ID for the equivalent Product resource in the REST Admin API
 7
 3
      "products": {
 4
        "edges": [
 5
          {
 6
            "node": {
 7
              "id": "gid://shopify/Product/4353554645014",
 8
              "legacyResourceId": "4353554645014"
 9
            }
 10
          },
 11
          {
 12
            "node": {
 13
              "id": "gid://shopify/Product/4353554710550",
 14
              "legacyResourceId": "4353554710550"
 15
            }
 16
          },
 17
          {
 18
            "node": {
 19
              "id": "gid://shopify/Product/4358159007766",
 20
              "legacyResourceId": "4358159007766"
 21
            }
 22
          },
 23
          {
 24
            "node": {
 25
              "id": "gid://shopify/Product/5591484858390",
 26
              "legacyResourceId": "5591484858390"
 27
            }
 28
          },
 29
          {
 30
            "node": {
 31
              "id": "gid://shopify/Product/5591485448214",
 32
              "legacyResourceId": "5591485448214"
 33
            }
 34
          }
 35
        ]
 36
      }
 37
    }
 38 }

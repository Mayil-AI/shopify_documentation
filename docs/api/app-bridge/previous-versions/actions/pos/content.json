 POS
 Note
 This is a legacy API. Use the latest version of POS instead.
 Provides a mechanism for closing the app when it's running in Shopify POS, and for retrieving information about a Shopify POS device.
 Requirements
 User and location data are available in all version of Point of Sale Android and iOS.
 Device data is available in following app version:
 Point of Sale iOS version 5.36.0 or above
 Point of Sale Android version 3.29.0 or above
 Close is available in the following app version:
 App Bridge version 1.18.0 or above is required
 Point of Sale iOS version 5.50.0 or above
 Point of Sale Android version 3.43.0 or above
 Setup
 Create an app and import the Pos module from @shopify/app-bridge/actions. Note that we'll be referring to this sample application throughout the examples below.
 Note
 In the following example, config is a valid App Bridge configuration object. Learn more about configuring App Bridge.
 1 import createApp from '@shopify/app-bridge';
 2 import {Pos} from '@shopify/app-bridge/actions';
 3
 4 const app = createApp(config);
 Close an app embedded in Shopify POS
 Create a Pos object that can be used to close the embedded app. You might close the embedded app after the user successfully completes an action to return them to the Shopify POS app.
 1 const pos = Pos.create(app);
 To close the embedded app, use the Pos object to dispatch the CLOSE action.
 1 // App Bridge 1.x
 2 pos.dispatch(Pos.ActionType.CLOSE);
 3
 4 // App Bridge 2.x
 5 pos.dispatch(Pos.Action.CLOSE);
 Get POS data
 POS data is available in the state and accessible through app.getState(). There are several ways to get the data:
 Option 1: get all state
 1 app.getState().then((data) => {
 2
    const {pos} = data;
 3 });
 Option 2: get only pos
 1 app.getState('pos').then((pos) => {
 2 });
 Option 3: get only pos user
 1 app.getState('pos.user').then((user) => {
 2 });
 Option 4: get only pos location
 1 app.getState('pos.location').then((location) => {
 2 });
 Option 5: get only pos device
 1 app.getState('pos.device').then((device) => {
 2 });
 Note
 app.getState() just returns current state. To avoid getting state before it is ready, you may need to subscribe as below:
 1 const unsubscribe = app.subscribe(function() {
 2
    app.getState('pos').then(function(pos) {
 3
      if (!pos) {
 4
        return;
 5
      }
 6
      unsubscribe();
 7
    });
 8 });

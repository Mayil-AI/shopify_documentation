 Navigation
 There are two action sets related to navigation in Shopify App Bridge:
 History
 Redirect
 Both action sets allow you to access the top-level browser URL.
 The History action set allows you to use the JavaScript History API to modify the top-level browser URL without navigating. Use the History action set to update the top-level browser URL to match your app.
 The Redirect action set allows you to modify the top-level browser URL. Use the Redirect action set to navigate within your app, or to redirect users elsewhere in the Shopify admin or on the web.
 Using client-side routing
 By default, App Bridge applies URL changes from outside your app, such as from a navigation item being clicked, by changing the iframe URL. If your app uses client-side routing, such as React Router, then you need to override this behaviour to avoid unnecessary full-page reloads.
 To override the default behavior, subscribe to the Redirect.Action.APP action.
 1 import {Redirect} from '@shopify/app-bridge/actions';
 2
 3 app.subscribe(Redirect.Action.APP, function(redirectData) {
 4
    console.log(redirectData.path); // For example, '/settings'
 5 });
 When your app has a subscription to this action, App Bridge doesn't change the iframe URL. Instead, it passes the path to your callback function, where you can pass the path to your client-side router.
 If you are using React, take advantage of the router prop in the Provider to configure this functionality.

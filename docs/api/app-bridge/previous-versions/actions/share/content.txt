 This is a legacy API. Use the latest version of Share instead.
 The Share action allows you to invoke the "share sheet" to share content from your embedded app on an iOS or Android device.

 Setup
 Create an app and import the Share module from @shopify/app-bridge/actions. Note that we'll be referring to this sample application throughout the examples below.

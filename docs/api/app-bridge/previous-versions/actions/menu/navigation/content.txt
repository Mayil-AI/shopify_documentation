 Navigation Menu
 Note
 This is a legacy API. Use the latest version of the App Bridge Navigation Menu instead.
 The NavigationMenu component creates a navigation menu for your app. On desktop web browsers, the navigation menu appears as part of the app nav, on the left of the screen. On Shopify mobile, the navigation menu appears in a dropdown from the TitleBar.
 There are 2 ways to use the navigation menu action set:
 Plain JavaScript
 React component
 Plain JavaScript
 Example code
 Import the createApp function from @shopify/app-bridge and the NavigationMenu and AppLink actions from @shopify/app-bridge/actions. Then use the createApp function to create an app.
 Note
 In the following example, config is a valid App Bridge configuration object. Learn more about configuring App Bridge.
 1 import createApp from '@shopify/app-bridge';
 2 import {AppLink, NavigationMenu} from '@shopify/app-bridge/actions';
 3
 4 const app = createApp(config);
 Create any number of AppLink instances and then pass them into NavigationMenu. Each AppLink instance represents a link on the menu.
 1 const itemsLink = AppLink.create(app, {
 2
    label: 'Items',
 3
    destination: '/items',
 4 });
 5
 6 const settingsLink = AppLink.create(app, {
 7
    label: 'Settings',
 8
    destination: '/settings',
 9 });
 10
 11 // create NavigationMenu with no active links
 12
 13 const navigationMenu = NavigationMenu.create(app, {
 14
    items: [itemsLink, settingsLink],
 15 });
 16
 17 // or create a NavigationMenu with the settings link active
 18
 19 const navigationMenu = NavigationMenu.create(app, {
 20
    items: [itemsLink, settingsLink],
 21
    active: settingsLink,
 22 });
 Note
 The first seven links are rendered by default. Anything above seven links is hidden under a View More section.
 Set an active nav item
 To update the active state for the menu, pass a link to the active option using the set method.
 Note
 App Bridge does not automatically set the active state.
 1 navigationMenu.set({active: settingsLink});
 Reset active nav item
 To clear the active link, pass undefined as the active option using the set method.
 1 navigationMenu.set({active: undefined});
 React

 14
              destination: '/about',
 15
            },
 16
          ]}
 17
          matcher={(link, location) => link.destination === location.pathname}
 18
        />
 19
      </Provider>
 20
    );
 21 }

 When using the App Bridge React library, you need to wrap all of your App Bridge React code inside of a single App Bridge Provider.

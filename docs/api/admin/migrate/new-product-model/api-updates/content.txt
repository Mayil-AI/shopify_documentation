 API updates
 Learn about the changes to the product-related elements in version 2024-04 of the GraphQL and REST Admin APIs.
 New queries for variant and option resource limits
 To determine the total number of variants and options that can be added to each product in a shop, you can now query a shop’s product variants and options resource limits using ShopResourceLimits:
 POST https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/api/unstable/graphql.json
 1 query ShopResourceLimits {
 2
    shop {
 3
      resourceLimits {
 4
        maxProductVariants
 5
        maxProductOptions
 6
      }
 7
    }
 8 }
 Mutations for managing product options and variants
 Tip
 For apps with an interactive UI workflow.
 New mutations to manage product options
 We’ve added the following mutations to the GraphQL Admin API that enable you to manage product options directly:
 productOptionsCreate
 productOptionUpdate
 productOptionsReorder
 productOptionsDelete
 Updated inputs to manage option values
 To manage option values with the new product model, we've added an optionValues field to the variants input on the following mutations in the GraphQL Admin API:
 productVariantsBulkCreate
 productVariantsBulkUpdate
 We've also added a productOptions field to the input on the productCreate mutation.
 New mutation for syncing product data
 Tip
 For apps with a database sync workflow.
 We've added the productSet mutation to the GraphQL Admin API, to create and update the state of a product per an external database. The mutation is available to sync in both asynchronous and synchronous modes. It has a productOption and a variants input. The variants input has an optionValues input for pulling product and variant data from the external database.
 Use this mutation when you're managing the state of the product model outside of Shopify, and want to update Shopify's product model state to reflect your external state. Examples are Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and Worksheets.
 Note
 The productSet mutation has an input limit of 2K variants when run asynchronously and only 100 variants when run synchronously.

 Learn more about addressing your use cases with the GraphQL Admin API's queries for retrieving data and mutations for adding and editing data.
 Webhook updates
 A variant_gids field will be retroactively added to all webhook versions. The field will list all variant GIDs in the format variant_gids: [{admin_graphql_api_id: ID!}].
 Product webhooks will return a full variants payload for the first 100 records. For variants 101+, the payload won't include the full variant details, but the variant_gids field will still be included for these variants.
 The following is an example payload:

 String filters
 Usage
 To apply filters to an output, add the filter and any filter parameters within the output's curly brace delimiters {{ }}, preceded by a pipe character |. In the example below, product is the object, title is its property, and upcase is the filter being applied.
 Filters with parameters
 Many filters accept parameters that let you specify how the filter should be applied. Some filters might require parameters to be valid.
 Using multiple filters
 Multiple filters can be used on one output. They're applied from left to right.
 Built-in filters

 Font filters modify font objects, which are defined in font theme settings. You can use font filters to load fonts or to obtain font variants.
 To learn how to access theme settings, refer to Settings.
 Refer to Shopify's font library for a list of all fonts and their variants.
 font_face
 font | font_face

 Was this section helpful?
 YesNo
 font_modify
 font | font_modify: string, string
 returns font
 Modifies a specific property of a given font.
 The font_modify filter requires two parameters. The first indicates which property should be modified and the second is either the new value, or modification amount, for that property.
 Tip
 You can access every variant of the chosen font's family by using font.variants. However, you can more easily access specific styles and weights by using the font_modify filter.
 The following table outlines the valid font properties and modification values:
 Property Modification value Output
 style normal Returns the normal variant of the same weight, if it exists.
 italic Returns the italic variant of the same weight, if it exists.
 oblique
 Returns the oblique variant of the same weight, if it exists.
 Oblique variants are similar to italic variants in appearance. All Shopify fonts have only oblique or italic variants, not both.
 weight 100 → 900 Returns a variant of the same style with the given weight, if it exists.
 normal Returns a variant of the same style with a weight of 400, if it exists.
 bold Returns a variant of the same style with a weight of 700, if it exists.
 +100 → +900
 Returns a variant of the same style with a weight incremented by the given value, if it exists.
 For example, if a font has a weight of 400, then using +100 would return the font with a weight of 500.
 -100 → -900
 Returns a variant of the same style with a weight decremented by the given value, if it exists.
 For example, if a font has a weight of 400, then using -100 would return the font with a weight of 300.
 lighter Returns a lighter variant of the same style by applying the rules used by the CSS font-weight property and browser fallback weights, if it exists.
 bolder Returns a bolder variant of the same style by applying the rules used by the CSS font-weight property and browser fallback weights, if it exists.
 Non-existent font variants
 If the font_modify filter tries to create a font variant that doesn't exist, then it returns nil. To handle this, you can either assign a fallback value with the default filter, or check for nil before using the variant.
 Was this section helpful?
 YesNo
 font_url
 font | font_url

 Format filters
 SHOPIFY
 Format filters apply formats to specific data types.
 date
 string | date: string
 returns string
 Converts a timestamp into another date format.
 The date filter accepts the same parameters as Ruby's strftime method for formatting the date. For a list of shorthand formats, refer to the Ruby documentation or strftime reference and sandbox.
 The current date
 You can apply the date filter to the keywords 'now' and 'today' to output the current timestamp.
 Note
 The timestamp will reflect the time that the Liquid was last rendered. Because of this, the timestamp might not be updated for every page view, depending on the context and caching.
 format
 string | date: format: string
 Specify a locale-aware date format. You can use the following formats:
 abbreviated_date
 basic
 date
 date_at_time
 default
 on_date
 short (deprecated)
 long (deprecated)
 Note
 You can also define custom formats in your theme's locale files.
 Setting format options in locale files
 You can define custom date formats in your theme's storefront locale files. These custom formats should be included in a date_formats category:
 1 "date_formats": {
 2
    "month_day_year": "%B %d, %Y"
 3 }
 Was this section helpful?
 YesNo
 json
 variable | json
 returns string
 Converts a string, or object, into JSON format.
 Tip
 When using the JSON output in JavaScript, you don't need to wrap it in quotes because the json filter includes them. The json filter also escapes any quotes inside the output.
 Product inventory
 When applied to a product object on any Shopify store created after December 5, 2017, the json filter doesn't output values for the inventory_quantity and inventory_policy properties of any associated variants. These properties are excluded to help prevent bots and crawlers from retrieving inventory quantities for stores to which they aren't granted access.
 If you need inventory information, you can access it through individual variants.
 Was this section helpful?
 YesNo

 When preload is set to true, a resource hint is sent as a Link header with a rel value of preload.
 1 Link: <STYLESHEET_URL>; rel=preload; as=style
 This option doesn't affect the HTML link tag directly.
 You should use the preload parameter sparingly. For example, consider preloading only render-blocking stylesheets that are needed for initial functionality of the page, such as above-the-fold content. To learn more about resource hints in Shopify themes, refer to Performance best practices for Shopify themes.

 translate
 string | t
 returns string
 Returns a string of translated text for a given translation key from a locale file.
 The translate filter has an alias of t, which is more commonly used.
 Tip
 To learn more about using the t filter, refer to storefront locale file usage or schema locale file usage.
 Section locales vs. theme locales
 The t filter can also reference keys defined in the locales object of section file's schema tag. Content that you put in the schema under the locales object is only accessible to that section. This is useful if you need to make a standalone section that you want to share between themes.
 Content that is global to a theme should be placed in the theme's locales directory. For example, you could include the expression "See more" in your locales directory to create a single translation. You could then use the translation in a blog post and on the product details page.
 Note
 Translations in the section's schema tag that aren't part of the locales object are used for merchant-facing text shown in the theme editor. These translations don't use the t filter.

 Built-in filters
 Math filters
 Math filters perform mathematical operations on numbers. You can apply math filters to numbers, or variables or metafields that return a number.
 As with any other filters, you can use multiple math filters on a single input. They’re applied from left to right. In the example below, minus is applied first, then times, and finally divided_by.
 1 You save {{ product.compare_at_price | minus: product.price | times: 100.0 | divided_by: product.compare_at_price }}%

 image_tag
 string | image_tag
 returns string
 Generates an HTML <img> tag for a given image_url.
 By default, width and height attributes are added to the <img> tag based on the dimensions and aspect ratio from the image URL. However, you can override these attributes with the width and height parameters. If only one parameter is provided, then only that attribute is added.
 Lazy loading
 If you don't apply the preload attribute to image_tag, then loading is automatically set to lazy for images in sections further down the page. You shouldn't lazy load images above the fold. If the default value doesn't work for your theme, then consider writing your own logic using the section.index and section.location properties. For more information, refer to the section object.
 image_tag and focal points
 This filter automatically applies a focal point to the image using the object-position CSS style, if focal point coordinates are available. You can also access an image's focal point coordinates directly through the focal_point object. Learn how to set a focal point.
 width
 image_url | image_tag: width: number
 Specify the width attribute of the <img> tag. You can set the parameter to nil to prevent the attribute from being added.
 height
 image_url | image_tag: height: number
 Specify the height attribute of the <img> tag. You can set the parameter to nil to prevent the attribute from being added.
 sizes
 image_url | image_tag: sizes: string
 Specify source sizes with the HTML sizes attribute.
 widths
 image_url | image_tag: widths: string
 By default, Shopify generates a srcset with a smart set of default widths up to the maximum defined in the image URL. However, you can create your own set of widths.
 srcset
 image_url | image_tag: srcset: string
 By default, Shopify generates a srcset. However, you can create your own srcset. The srcset parameter takes precedence over the width parameter. You shouldn't to use the srcset parameter unless you want to remove the attribute by setting the parameter to nil.
 preload
 image_url | image_tag: preload: boolean
 Specify whether the image should be preloaded.
 When preload is set to true, a resource hint is sent as a Link HTTP header with a rel value of preload. The Link header also includes imagesrcset and imagesizes that match the srcset and sizes attribute of the tag, where present:
 1 Link: <IMAGE_URL>; rel=preload; as=image
 2 Link: <IMAGE_URL>; rel=preload; as=image; imagesrcset=ADDITIONAL_IMAGE_URL 352w; imagesizes=40vw
 This option doesn't affect the HTML img tag directly.
 You should use the preload parameter sparingly. For example, consider preloading only above-the-fold images. To learn more about resource hints in Shopify themes, refer to Performance best practices for Shopify themes.
 alt
 image_url | image_tag: alt: string
 By default, the alt attribute of the <img> tag is set to the media alt text, or the resource title for article, collection, line item, product, and variant images. However, you can override this default, or set the value if there's no default.
 HTML attributes
 image_url | image_tag: attribute: string
 You can specify HTML attributes by adding a parameter that matches the attribute name, and the desired value.
 Was this section helpful?
 YesNo
 image_url

 line_item
 product
 variant
 country
 Caution
 You need to specify either a width or height parameter. If neither are specified, then an error is returned.
 Note
 Regardless of the specified dimensions, an image can never be resized to be larger than its original dimensions.
 Code
 1
 {{ product | image_url: width: 450 }}
 Output
 1 //polinas-potent-potions.myshopify.com/cdn/shop/files/science-beakers-blue-light-new.jpg?v=1683744744&width=450
 width
 variable | image_url: width: number
 Specify the width of the image up to a maximum of 5760px. If only the width is specified, then the height is automatically calculated based on the image's dimensions.
 height
 variable | image_url: height: number
 Specify the height of the image up to a maximum of 5760px. If only the height is specified, then the width is automatically calculated based on the image's dimensions.
 crop

 The default value is center.
 When using the region crop mode, the starting point for the crop is defined by crop_left and crop_top and extends to the crop_width and crop_height. Optionally, to resize the region extracted by the crop, use the width and height parameters.
 Note
 Country flags are SVG images and can only be cropped if a value for format is also provided.
 format
 variable | image_url: format: string
 Specify which file format to use for the image. The valid formats are pjpg and jpg.
 It's not practical to convert a lossy image format, like jpg, to a lossless image format, like png, so Shopify can do only the following conversions:
 png to jpg
 png to pjpg
 jpg to pjpg
 Note
 Shopify automatically detects which image formats are supported by the client (e.g. WebP, AVIF, etc.) and selects a file format for optimal quality and file size. When a format is specified, Shopify takes into account the features (e.g. progressive, alpha channel) of the specified file format when making the final automatic format selection. To learn more, visit https://cdn.shopify.com/.
 pad_color

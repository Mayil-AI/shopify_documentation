 Objects
 Liquid objects represent variables that you can use to build your theme. Object types include store resources, standard Shopify content, and functional elements that help you to build interactivity.
 Objects might represent a single data point, or contain multiple properties. Some properties might represent a related object, such as a product in a collection.
 Note
 Liquid objects are also often referred to as Liquid variables.
 Usage
 Objects, along with their properties, are wrapped in curly brace delimiters {{ }}.
 For example, the product object contains a property called title that can be used to output the title of a product.
 Object access
 The way that you access an object depends on the object and the context in which you want to access it. An object might be accessed in the following ways:
 Globally: The object can be accessed directly in any Liquid theme file, excluding checkout.liquid and Liquid asset files.
 In a template: The object can be accessed directly in specific templates, or in sections or blocks included in the template. For example, you can access the product object directly in a product template, or a section referenced in a product template.
 Through a parent object: Many objects are returned by another object, or as a property of a parent object. For example, you can access article objects through the global articles object, or through the articles property of the blog object.
 Refer to each object to learn about how it can be accessed.
 Creating
 You can also create your own variables using variable tags. Variables are treated like objects syntactically.
 additional_checkout_buttons
 object
 Returns true if a store has any payment providers with offsite checkouts, such as PayPal Express Checkout.
 Use additional_checkout_buttons to check whether these payment providers exist, and content_for_additional_checkout_buttons to show the associated checkout buttons. To learn more about how to use these objects, refer to Accelerated checkout.

 all_country_option_tags
 object
 Creates an <option> tag for each country.
 An attribute called data-provinces is set for each <option>, and contains a JSON-encoded array of the country or region's subregions. If a country doesn't have any subregions, then an empty array is set for its data-provinces attribute.
 Tip
 To return only the countries and regions included in the store's shipping zones, use the country_option_tags object.
 You can wrap the all_country_option_tags object in <select> tags to build a country option selector.
 1 <select name="country">

    {{ all_country_option_tags }}

 metafield
 object
 A metafield attached to a parent object.
 To learn about how to access a metafield on a specific object, refer to Access metafields.
 Metafields support multiple data types, which determine the kind of information that's stored in the metafield. You can also output the metafield content in a type-specific format using metafield filters.
 Note
 You can't create metafields in Liquid. Metafields can be created in only the following ways:
 In the Shopify admin
 Through an app
 Note
 Metafields of type integer, json_string, and string are older implementations that don't have the properties noted on this page, and aren't compatible with metafield filters. To learn more, refer to Deprecated metafields.
 Properties

 Access metafields
 The access path for metafields consists of two layers:
 namespace - A grouping of metafields to prevent conflicts.
 key - The metafield name.
 Given this, you can access the metafield object with the following syntax:
 1 {{ resource.metafields.namespace.key }}
 Accessing metafields of type json
 The value property of metafields of type json returns a JSON object. You can access the properties of this object directly in Liquid, either by name or 0-based index. You can also iterate through the properties.
 Accessing metafields of type list
 The value property of metafields of type list returns an array. You can iterate through the array to access the values.
 
 
 If the list is of type single_line_text_field, then you can access the items in the array directly in Liquid using a 0-based index.
 Determining the length of a list metafield
 The way that you determine the length of a list metafield depends on its type:
 Reference types: Use the count property to determine the list length.
 Non-reference types: These lists are rendered as arrays. Use the size filter to determine the number of items in the array.
 Deprecated metafields
 Deprecated metafields are older metafield types with limited functionality. The following metafield types are deprecated:
 integer
 json_string
 string
 These metafield types don't have the same metafield object properties mentioned in the previous sections. Instead, they return the metafield value directly.
 The following table outlines the value type for each deprecated metafield type:
 Metafield type Value type
 integer An integer
 json_string A JSON object
 string A string

 metaobject
 object
 A metaobject entry, which includes the values for a set of fields. The set is defined by the parent metaobject_definition.
 Properties
 system
 metaobject_system
 Access metaobjects individually
 The access path for a metaobject consists of two layers:
 type - The type of the parent metaobject definition.
 handle - The unique handle of the metaobject.
 Given this, you can access a metaobject with the following syntax:
 1 {{ shop.metaobjects.type.handle }}
 You can also use square bracket notation:
 1 {{ shop.metaobjects['type']['handle'] }}
 A metaobjects's field values can be accessed using the key of the desired field:
 1 {{ shop.metaobjects.testimonials.homepage.title }}
 2 {{ shop.metaobjects['highlights']['washable'].image.value }}
 Note
 When the publishable capability is enabled, a metaobject can only be accessed if its status is active. If its status is draft, then the return value is nil.
 Usage in metaobject templates
 Within a metaobject template, the metaobject Liquid object represents the metaobject drop being rendered by the template. You can access it directly as {{ metaobject }}.
 Here's a basic example of accessing a field within the associated metaobject template:
 1 {{ metaobject.title.value }}
 In this example, replace title with the key of the field you want to access. This will output the value of that field for the current metaobject.

 metaobject_definition
 object
 A metaobject_definition defines the structure of a metaobject type for the store, which consists of a merchant-defined set of field definitions.
 One or more corresponding metaobject objects contain values for the fields specified in the metaobject definition.
 Properties
 values
 array of metaobject
 values_count
 number
 Loop over entries of a metaobject definition
 If a metaobject definition has multiple metaobject entries, then you can loop over them using the values property. You can loop over a maximum of 50 entries in a metaobject definition. For example, you can display the field author for each metaobject using the following forloop:
 1 {% for testimonial in shop.metaobjects.testimonials.values %}
 2
    {{ testimonial.author.value }}
 3 {% endfor %}
 Note
 When the publishable capability is enabled, loops return only metaobjects with a status of active. Metaobjects with a status of draft are skipped.

 Using the metaobject_system object

 1 {{ shop.metaobjects.testimonials["home_page"].system.id }}
 You can also access metaobject_system properties when iterating over a list of metaobjects:
 1 {% for metaobject in product.metafields.custom.mixed_metaobject_list.value %}
 2
    {% if metaobject.system.type == "testimonial" %}

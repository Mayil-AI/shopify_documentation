 Name Type Description
 to? string Destination to navigate to. You must provide either this property, onPress, or both.
 external? boolean Open the link in a new window or tab

 onPress? () => void Callback when pressed. If to is provided, it will execute the callback and then navigate to the location specified by to.
 Best practices
 If the link isn’t in a paragraph, consider using a plain button instead to get a larger hit area.
 Use links primarily for navigation and button primarily for actions.
 The HTML that renders for the Button and Link components carries meaning. Using these components intentionally and consistently results in a more inclusive experience for assistive technology users and a more cohesive visual experience for sighted users.

 Button: Buttons are used for actions, such as “Add”, “Continue”, or “Pay now”, or “Save”.
 ButtonGroup: A button group controls the layout for two or more stacked buttons such as “Continue” and “Return to cart”, and adds the necessary spacing between them.

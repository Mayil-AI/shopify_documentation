 Radio
 Use radios to present each item in a list of options where buyers must make a single selection. Radio components should always appear in groups of two or more; if a buyer has only a single, boolean option, use a checkbox instead.
 Unlike most field components, any children passed to this component will be used as the label for the checkbox.
 JS
 React
 1 import {extend, Radio} from '@shopify/post-purchase-ui-extensions';

 3 extend('Checkout::PostPurchase::Render', (root) => {
 4
    const radio = root.createComponent(
 5
      Radio,
 6
      {id: 'radio', name: 'radio'},
 7
      'I want this choice',
 8
    );

 10
    root.appendChild(radio);
 11 });
 Props
 optional = ?
 Name Type Description
 id? string A unique identifier for the field. When no id is provided, a globally unique value will be used instead.
 name string An identifier for the field that is unique within the nearest containing &lt;Form /&gt; component. When you create multiple radio components representing different options for the same choice, each one should have the same name property.
 value? boolean Whether the radio is selected. This prop is an alias for checked, and can be useful in form libraries that provide a normalized API for dealing with both boolean and string values. If both value and checked are provided, checked takes precedence.
 checked? boolean Whether the radio is selected.
 disabled? boolean Whether the radio can be changed.
 accessibilityLabel? string A label to use for the field that will be used for buyers using assistive technologies. When provided, any children supplied to this component are hidden from being seen for accessibility purposes to prevent duplicate content from being read.
 onChange? (value: boolean) => void A callback that is run whenever the checkbox is changed. This callback is called with a boolean indicating whether the radio should now be active or inactive. This component is controlled, so you must store this value in state and reflect it back in the checked or value props.

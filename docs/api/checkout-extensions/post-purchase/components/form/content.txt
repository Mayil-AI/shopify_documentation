Product subscription app extensions
 Form
 The Form component should be used to wrap one or more form controls. This component provides an "implicit submit" behavior, where buyers can submit the form from any input by pressing "enter" on their keyboards. This behavior is widely expected, and should be respected as often as possible.
 Unlike an HTML form element, this component does not support configuring the descendant fields to be submitted via HTTP automatically. Instead, you must provide an onSubmit callback that will perform the necessary HTTP requests in JavaScript.

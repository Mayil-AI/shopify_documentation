 Best practices
 Button labels should be clear so customers can predict what the results of interacting with a button will be.
 Use primary buttons for actions that will progress the customer through checkout, such as "Continue to shipping", and "Pay now".
 Use secondary buttons for actions that you want to draw attention to, but are not primary, such as ”Track your order”.
 Use plain buttons when you want the appearance of a text link, but the hit area of a button. Works well alongside other buttons to create hierarchies such as “Continue” and “Return to cart”.
 Related components
 ButtonGroup: A button group controls the layout for two or more stacked buttons such as “Continue” and “Return to cart”, and adds the necessary spacing between them.

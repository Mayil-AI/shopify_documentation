 ButtonGroup
 A button group is meant to wrap around two or more buttons, passed as children. The button group will stack these buttons along the inline axis, and add the necessary spacing between them.
 Example
 JS
 React
 1 import {extend, ButtonGroup, Button} from '@shopify/post-purchase-ui-extensions';
 2
 3 extend('Checkout::PostPurchase::Render', (root) => {
 4
    const buttonGroup = root.createComponent(ButtonGroup, undefined, [
 5
      root.createComponent(Button, undefined, 'Cancel'),
 6
      root.createComponent(Button, undefined, 'Submit'),
 7
    ]);
 8
 9
    root.appendChild(buttonGroup);
 10 });

 Tiles
 The Tiles component is used to lay out elements as equally-sized elements, optionally wrapping on multiple lines as well as a stack when space is limited. If you have a direct child of Tiles that you donâ€™t want to stretch, wrap that child in a View component.
 JS
 React
 1 import {extend, View, Tiles} from '@shopify/post-purchase-ui-extensions';
 2
 3 extend('Checkout::PostPurchase::Render', (root) => {
 4
    const tiles = root.createComponent(Tiles, undefined, [
 5
      root.createComponent(View, {border: 'base', padding: 'base'}, 'View'),
 6
      root.createComponent(View, {border: 'base', padding: 'base'}, 'View'),
 7
      root.createComponent(View, {border: 'base', padding: 'base'}, 'View'),
 8
    ]);

    root.appendChild(tiles);
 11 });

 Components for Post-purchase extensions
 Post-purchase extensions provide many powerful UI components that a rendering extension can use to build an interface. This UI is rendered natively by Shopify, so you can depend on it to be performant, accessible, and work in all of checkoutâ€™s supported browsers.
 The following components are available as part of post-purchase extensions for checkout, but make sure that you check the documentation for your extension point to ensure the component is available in the extension points you are targeting.

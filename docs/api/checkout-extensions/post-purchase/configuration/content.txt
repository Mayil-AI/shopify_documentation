 Post-purchase extensions configuration
 When you create a post-purchase extension, the shopify.extension.toml file is automatically generated in your extension directory. This guide describes the properties that you can configure in shopify.extension.toml.
 How it works
 You define properties for your extension in the extension configuration file. The shopify.extension.toml file contains the extension's settings, which include the extension name and metafields.
 When an extension is published to Shopify, the contents of the configuration file are pushed alongside the extension.
 Anatomy of a configuration file
 The following example shows the properties in the shopify.extension.toml file:
 shopify.extension.toml
 1 type = "post_purchase"
 2 name = "checkout_post_purchase"
 3
 4 # [[metafields]]
 5 # namespace: my-namespace
 6 # key: my-key
 7
 8 # [[metafields]]
 9 # namespace: my-namespace
 10 # key: my-key-2
 Property Required? Description
 type Yes The type of extension. For checkout post-purchase extensions, this value is always checkout_post_purchase.
 name Yes The name of the checkout post-purchase extension.
 metafields Yes The metafields that your extension needs to read.
 
 You can specify up to five key and namespace pairs in the configuration file. When the extension is executed, Shopify looks for the metafields in each resource and returns their contents.

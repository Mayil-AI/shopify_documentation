 Product Search API
 The Product Search API gives the UI Extension access to the native product search and fetching functionality of Shopify POS. The interface provides numerous functions to search for products by query, or to fetch the details of one or more products or product variants.
 Searching for products
 The following example shows how a UI Extension can use the searchProducts method to easily access search results based on a queryString passed in the ProductSearchParams object.

    async function searchProducts(query: string) {
 4
      const searchResults = await api.productSearch.searchProducts({queryString: query})
 5
      console.log(searchResults);
 6
    }

    const searchBarProps: SearchBarProps = {
 9
      placeholder: 'Search products',
 10
      onSearch: searchProducts,
 11
      onTextChange: searchProducts,
 12
    }

    const searchBar = root.createComponent(SearchBar, searchBarProps);
 15
    const screen = root.createComponent(Screen, {name: 'Home', title: 'Home'});

    screen.appendChild(searchBar);

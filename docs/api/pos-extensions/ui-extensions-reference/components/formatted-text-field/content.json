 FormattedTextField
 Use a formatted text field when you require additional functionality such as the textfield input type or a custom validator.
 Props
 Name Type Description Options
 inputType InputType? Determines the characters and format the merchant is permitted to input. "text" | "currency" | "giftcard" | "email"
 title string? The text displayed as the text field title.
 initialValue string? The initial text value in the text field.
 placeholder string? Hint text to display when no text is input.
 errorMessage string? The text displayed when an error is detected on merchant input. Displayed beneath the field.
 isValid boolean? Whether the input is a valid option.
 autoCapitalize boolean? Whether or not the entered text should auto capitalize.
 onChangeText ((value: string) => void)? A callback containing the new string when the text field’s value changes.
 customValidator ((text: string) => boolean)? A callback that provides the current value as a string. Return true or false if the string passes validation, and the text field will invalidate/validate.
 Guidelines
 When a merchant opens a new form, the first text field should be in a focused state.
 If the merchant is actively focused in a text field, then the keyboard should come up and the label should move to the top of the field.
 If focus goes away from the text field, then the keyboard should hide.
 Text fields always take up the full screen width.
 Text fields don’t change height. If text entered is longer than the width of the text field, then the oldest text on the left should be hidden to make room.
 When it makes sense, provide autocomplete options (for example, entering an address).
 Content guidelines
 If a text field is required, then it should indicate "Required".
 Label titles should be brief and written in sentence case.
 Use the same terms for similar label titles throughout the app.
 Any empty text field shouldn't have help text showing an example of how a text field should be filled out.

 Selectable
 The selectable component allows you to wrap any non-interactive UI component to make it selectable.
 Props
 Name Type Description
 onPress () => void A callback to be performed when the selectable component is pressed.
 disabled boolean? Whether the selectable component is disabled.
 Guidelines
 Selectable is intended to be used along with non-interactive components like <Text>.
 Interactive components like <TextField>, or any other component that accepts onPress callbacks, have their own built-in interactions. Wrapping these components in selectable might potentially break their intended behavior.
 It is recommended to provide a visual clue to the non-interactive component so it appears as interactive. For example, you could set a color prop on <Text> component to "TextInteractive" value so that the users can identify this element as being interactive.

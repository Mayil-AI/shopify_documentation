 Content guidelines
 Subtitles:
 Each subtitle should have a different piece of information. Don’t use dashes to display more than one type of information on the same line.
 Subtitles should be shown in order of relevance.
 If you’re showing the results of the form, the label should be the form field title and the subtitle should be the information the merchant entered.

 ScrollView
 The ScrollView component allows content that doesnâ€™t fully fit on screen to scroll. Typically, the ScrollView component serves as the root component of a Screen.
 Guidelines
 The ScrollView component applies a mandatory horizontal margin to inset the content according to our design guidelines. This is the equivalent of applying paddingHorizontal="ExtraExtraLarge" on a Stack component. If you have content outside of your ScrollView that needs to be inset to align with the content of your ScrollView, you can wrap this content in a Stack component and applying a paddingHorizontal of ExtraExtraLarge

 Other sections have subdued text within an outlined inactive area to indicate that they’re actionable.
 Content guidelines
 Keep the content very short and brief, ideally only 1-2 words.
 Each label should be structured in the same way, so that they’re easy to compare. For example, they could all be nouns:
 ✅ For discounts: Amount / Percentage
 ❌ For discounts: Amount off / %

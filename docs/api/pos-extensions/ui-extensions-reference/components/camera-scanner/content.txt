 CameraScanner
 The camera scanner uses the device's camera to scan and decode barcodes or QR codes. It displays a live feed with guidance markers for alignment and triggers actions within the app upon successful recognition.

 Camera Scanning
 Camera scanning is available when the device has a camera and the user grants POS permission to access it. For third-party apps, camera scanning can be initiated from within the app via a ‘Button’ component that launches the camera scanner feature.
 Full Screen
 The full-screen camera scanning UI should resemble the functionality in the core POS app.
 Best practices
 Error Scanning
 Utilize the error banner to display scanning errors or unrecognized barcodes at the top of the camera view screen.
 Successful Scanning
 After a successful scan, dismiss the full-screen camera view and display a secondary screen showcasing the intended outcome.
 Partial Screen
 The camera scanner UI can be adjusted to display the camera view on part of the screen while dedicating the remaining portion to other components. This can be useful for tasks like inventory management.
 Best practices
 Blocking Scenarios
 In situations where scanning should not be allowed within a specific section of your application, use an error banner to inform merchants that scanning is not permitted on that screen and offer alternative areas where the scanning function can be performed.
 Error Scanning
 Use the error banner at the top of the screen to denote errors while scanning or when encountering an unrecognized barcode.
 Successful Scanning
 Upon successful scanning of an item, display a ‘Toast’ component with a message such as "Item scanned" to indicate the outcome. Additionally, altering the screen contents can also be used to signal a successful scan.
 Content guidelines

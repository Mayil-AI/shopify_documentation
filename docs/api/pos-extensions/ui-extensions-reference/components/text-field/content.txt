 TextField
 Use a text field to allow merchants to enter or edit text. If you want to specify the kind of input, then use a formatted text field.
 NewTextFieldProps
 Name Type Description
 disabled boolean? Whether the field can be modified.
 error string? Indicate an error to the user. The field will be given a specific stylistic treatment to communicate problems that have to be resolved immediately.
 label label? Content to use as the field label.
 onBlur () => void? Callback when focus is removed.
 onChange (value: string) => void? Callback when the user has finished editing a field.
 onFocus () => void? Callback when input is focused.
 onInput (value: string) => void? Callback when the user makes any changes in the field. As noted in the documentation for onChange, you must not use this to update value — use the onChange callback for that purpose. Use the onInput prop when you need to do something as soon as the user makes a change, like clearing validation errors that apply to the field as soon as the user begins making the necessary adjustments.
 placeholder string? A short hint that describes the expected value of the field.
 required boolean? Whether the field needs a value.
 value string? The current value for the field. If omitted, the field will be empty. You should update this value in response to the onChange callback.
 helpText string? Label under the text field which provides guidance or instructions that assist users.
 action InputAction? A button under the text field to provide extra funtionality.
 InputAction
 Name Type Description
 label string The text displayed in the button.
 disabled boolean? Whether the button can be pressed.
 onPress () => void A callback to be performed.

 Guidelines
 When a merchant opens a new form, the first text field should be in a focused state.
 If the merchant is actively focused in a text field, then the keyboard should come up and the label should move to the top of the field.
 If focus goes away from the text field, then the keyboard should hide.
 Text fields always take up the full screen width.
 Text fields don’t change height. If text entered is longer than the width of the text field, then the oldest text on the left should be hidden to make room.
 When it makes sense, provide autocomplete options (for example, entering an address).
 Content guidelines
 If a text field is required, then it should indicate "Required".
 Label titles should be brief and written in sentence case.
 Use the same terms for similar label titles throughout the app.

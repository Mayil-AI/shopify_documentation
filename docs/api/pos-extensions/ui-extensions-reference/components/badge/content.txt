 Guidelines
 Badges should be positioned as close as possible to the item they’re related to.
 Content guidelines
 Be concise. Use a single word to describe the status of an item. Only use two or three words if you need to describe a complex state, for example "partially fulfilled".
 ✅ fulfilled
 ❌ order fulfilled
 Statuses should ideally be written as adjectives:
 ✅ unpaid
 ❌ payment not received

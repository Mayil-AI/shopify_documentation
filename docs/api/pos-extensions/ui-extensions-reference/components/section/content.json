 Name Type Description
 title string The name of the action that will be displayed on top of the card.

 Guidelines
 Sections will frequently feature a header to describe what is in the list below, especially if there is more than one section in a ScrollView. In cases where there is only one section in a ScrollView, the section header is redundant with the page header and not recommended. Sections may also feature an SectionHeaderAction which is displayed in the top right of the card. This action should be used for actions that affect the whole section such as ‘edit’ or ‘manage.’ Tapping the action opens a modal view.
 Content guidelines
 Keep section headers concise. Ideally, they should be 1-2 words.
 Section headers should describe what’s in the list, not provide instructions.
 ✅ Receipt options
 ❌ Provide receipt
 ❌ Select receipt option
 Content shouldn’t change dynamically (for example, section headers shouldn’t show count). This is to keep content scannable and create reliable expectations throughout the app.
 ✅ Addresses
 ❌ 3 addresses

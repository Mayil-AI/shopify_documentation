 Guidelines
 ðŸ“± Do not nest other components other than Text. They will not be rendered. Use nested Text to render text content within the Banner.
 ðŸ“± Do not nest banners inside horizontal Stacks, Pressables, ResourceItems, Cards, or CardSections. This will result in unintended behavior.
 âœ… Do ðŸ›‘ Don't
 Place Banners at the top of the page or section they apply to Use too many Banners at one time
 Use status to provide additional context to the merchant

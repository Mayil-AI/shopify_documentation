 Guidelines
 Buttons will wrap their content if placed inside a Stack component, otherwise they will expand to the width of the container
 Buttons wrap their content, regardless of the container they are placed in
 ✅ Do 🛑 Don't
 Align buttons vertically Buttons should not be stacked horizontally
 Use short, succinct titles that describe an action
 Use an icon to supplement the title of the button
 Use only a single primary Button per section
 Primary buttons should be before secondary buttons
 For more guidelines, refer to Polaris' Button best practices.

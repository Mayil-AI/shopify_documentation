 Guidelines
 ðŸ“± Headings should clearly describe the section of interface they refer to
 ðŸ“± Use Headings to highlight the most important concept or piece of information merchants need to know
 âœ… Do ðŸ›‘ Don't
 Use headings to support the hierarchy and structure of the page Nest too many Headings in one area
 Place Headings at the top of a page or section they refer to
 For more guidelines, refer to Polaris' Text best practices.

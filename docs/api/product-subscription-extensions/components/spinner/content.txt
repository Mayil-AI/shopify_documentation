 Spinner
 Spinners are used to show merchants that your app is loading, or an action is being performed. Generally when a spinner is being used, the user shouldn't be able to interact.
 JavaScript
 React
 1 import {extend, Spinner} from '@shopify/admin-ui-extensions';
 2
 3 extend('Playground', (root) => {
 4
    const spinner = root.createComponent(Spinner);
 5
    root.appendChild(spinner);
 6
 7
    setTimeout(() => {
 8
      root.removeChild(spinner);
 9
    }, 2000);
 10
 11
    root.mount();
 12 });
 âœ… Do ðŸ›‘ Don't
 Use Spinner to show that content is loading, or an action is being processed Donâ€™t place Spinners for each loading element. Rather, Spinners should be at the top level of the section they apply to.

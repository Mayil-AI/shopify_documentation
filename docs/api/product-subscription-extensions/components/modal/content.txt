 Modal
 Modals are overlays that prevent merchants from interacting with the rest of the application until a specific action is taken.
 Modals are disruptive by design, requiring merchants to take an action before they can continue, so use them thoughtfully and sparingly.

 React
 1 import {extend, Modal} from '@shopify/admin-ui-extensions';

    const modal = root.createComponent(Modal, {

      title: 'The best modal',

      onClose: () => console.log('modal closed!'),

      open: true,

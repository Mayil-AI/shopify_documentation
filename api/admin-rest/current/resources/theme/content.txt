 Theme
 Requires themes access scope.
 A theme controls the look and feel of a Shopify online store.
 A store can have a maximum of 20 themes, one of which is the published theme that customers see when they visit the online store. Customers can't see unpublished themes. When you publish a theme, the previously published theme becomes unpublished.
 To modify theme files after they're uploaded, use the Asset resource. To learn how to create your own theme, refer to Building themes
